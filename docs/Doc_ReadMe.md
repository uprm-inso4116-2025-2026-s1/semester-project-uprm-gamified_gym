# ASCII Documentation Content Guide
Gamified_Gym members, as per our contract with the specifications of this course project, this document will serve as a guide on what to document and where to do it.

## Index
This is a document that can help you jump into the respective document you need to access. This will be helpful when we have more documentation files.

## Milestones
Contains the overview on what each milestone will achieve. Along with any vital details which includes finalized work.

## Meetings
Meetings that you schedule with your group and scrum discussion on fridays will be documented here. The groups are separated in order to see when the groups meet. This will mainly feature the highlights for these meetings. Note: As long as you communicate well you won't be in trouble due to the lack of official meetings.

## Requirements
Goals (What problem are we solving?)
Write 3–5 bullet points that describe the purpose of the system.
Example:
Allow users to record exercise activities.
Provide a gamified experience to increase motivation.
Track progress over time for self-improvement.

Non-goals (What are we not doing?)
List things you won’t cover (so scope is clear).
Example:
No integration with fitness wearables.
No medical/health advice.
Not building a commercial-grade deployment.

Features (What does the system actually do?)
List concrete system functions.
Each bullet should describe something users will be able to do or the system will support.
Example:
Users can create and update exercises.
Users can log workout sessions with repetitions and calories.
The system awards points or badges for completed activities.
A history of activities is stored and viewable.
