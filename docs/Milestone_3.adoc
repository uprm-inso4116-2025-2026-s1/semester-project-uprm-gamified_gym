==== 2.1.1 Domain Rough Sketch (Raw Stories)
=== Raw Story: First Week Attempting Cardio

Athlete recounts:
"I started with treadmill jogging at 5.0 mph. This was only my fourth day trying to work out consistently, so I paid attention to how my steps landed as the belt started moving. My arms felt stiff, and my breathing picked up quickly even though the pace wasn’t fast.

The first few strides felt heavy. I wasn’t used to running, and I could feel the impact on my shins. My steps sounded louder than I expected, and it took effort to keep a steady rhythm. Sweat formed early on my forehead.

On minute three, I noticed a side stitch forming and my calves tightening. The stitch showed up suddenly and made it hard to breathe smoothly. My calves felt tight every time my foot hit the belt. My breathing grew louder and more irregular.

I paused briefly to decide whether to continue. I held the side rails, slowed to a walk, and tried to bring my breathing down. I watched the timer to see if the stitch would fade.

I tried jogging again, but my breathing spiked almost immediately and my legs felt unsteady. My feet landed flat, and each step felt heavier than the last. It was clear I couldn’t hold the pace.

I stopped early because the tightness in my calves and the side stitch weren’t going away. I stepped off the treadmill and walked slowly for a bit before moving on to stretching."

=== Raw Story: Returning to Squats After Injury

Lifter recounts:
"I started with barbell squats at 95 pounds. I hadn’t squatted in almost two months, so I took extra time setting my stance and getting under the bar. The first descent felt unfamiliar, and I focused on keeping the bar stable on my back.

The first few reps felt tight around my hips and lower back. My brace didn’t feel as solid as it used to, and I felt the bar shift slightly to the right on the way up. My core didn’t feel fully engaged.

On rep four, I noticed my torso leaning forward more than usual and tension in my lower back. The movement slowed, and the rep felt uneven. My heels pressed into the floor at different intensities, and the bar path drifted.

I paused briefly to decide whether to continue. I stood still with the bar on my back and took slow breaths while I checked my stance in the mirror. My legs felt fine, but the tightness in my back hadn’t gone away.

I tried one more rep but my brace loosened as I went down. The bar shifted again and the ascent felt unstable. The rep slowed a lot halfway up, and I had to adjust my posture to finish it.

I stopped early because the lower-back tension increased and my form wasn’t consistent. I racked the bar and moved on to light mobility work instead of continuing the exercise."

=== Raw Story: Fatigue on Push Day

Gym-Goer recounts:
"I started with incline dumbbell press at 70 pounds. When I lifted the dumbbells onto my legs, they felt slightly heavier than usual. I set my shoulders back and began the first set, paying attention to how the weights moved.

The first few reps felt slower than normal. The press off the bottom didn’t feel as strong as it usually does, and my left shoulder felt tighter. The tension built quicker than I expected, and the movement pattern felt slightly uneven.

On rep six, I noticed my left arm drifting outward and the dumbbell wobbling. The push upward felt unsteady, and the rep slowed down compared to the earlier ones. My right arm handled the weight more easily than my left.

I paused briefly to decide whether to continue. I held the dumbbells at the bottom position and focused on my grip and breathing before attempting another rep.

I tried one more rep but the left dumbbell moved off its normal path again, and my shoulder shifted forward slightly. The rep didn’t feel controlled, and the weights became harder to steady.

I stopped early because the movement stayed unstable, and I didn’t want to continue with uneven reps. I lowered the weight and moved on to a machine chest press to finish the rest of my push session."

=== Raw Story: Trying to Hit Everything at Once

Gym-Goer recounts:
"I started with bench press at 95 pounds. I only lift once a week, so the movement felt rusty from the start. When I unracked the bar, it felt heavier than usual, and I had to adjust my grip before lowering the first rep.

The first few reps felt shaky. My right side pressed more smoothly than my left, and the bar wobbled slightly on the way up. My breathing grew louder as the reps continued, and I noticed my shoulders working harder than my chest.

On rep five, I noticed the bar drifting to the left and my elbows flaring. The rep slowed halfway up and felt uneven between my arms. My chest burned, and the lockout felt less stable.

I paused briefly to decide whether to continue. I held the bar at the top for a moment and focused on steadying my grip and checking if I could keep good form for another rep.

I tried one more rep but my arms shook and the bar path drifted again. The rep slowed significantly, and I needed more effort than usual to complete it.

I stopped early because the reps became unstable. Instead of continuing bench, I moved on to lat pulldowns to finish the rest of my workout."

==== 2.2.2 Personas
* Alex, the Beginner:
  ** Background and daily habits:
    Alex is a 28-year-old office worker from Miami, Florida. He works long hours at a marketing firm and often ends the day feeling
    drained. Outside of working hours, he enjoys cooking simple meals, listens to podcasts about technology and entrepreneurship, and occasionally
    playing casual mobile games to relax. Alex is new to fitness and often feels overwhelmed and feels out of place in a public gym, unsure of where to
    start or whether he is making any progress. His primary goal is to build a consistent workout habit to improve his health, energy levels,
    and overall well-being, as he feels sluggish from sitting all day at the office. His colleagues discussing fitness apps during lunch influences his desire for a polished, engaging user experience, which he might feel confident enough to share once he sees progress. Alex is motivated by music and likes to listen to high-energy playlists on Spotify during workouts to stay focused. He is curious, eager to learn, and wants clear guidance to help him feel confident and prevent unnecessary injuries as he begins his fitness journey.

  ** Motivations and goals:
   Alex isn't just trying to "build a habit." He wants to improve his energy levels to be more effective at his marketing job and eventually perhaps start his own business. 


  ** Pain points and needs:
The team will realize the app isn't just a fitness tool, but a stepping stone to entrepreneurial success and better time management, making features like progress visualization extremely important for tracking overall life progression, not just reps.
Gym Anxiety, this suggests he would benefit from a "solo mode" or privacy settings initially.
Alex’s interest in cooking simple meals suggests he might appreciate a section in the app with quick, easy-to-follow healthy recipes that fit into his busy evenings.
Alex interest in listening to music during workouts present expectation of seamless integration with existing tools like Spotify or other tools.
    Current fitness apps only log data but fail to provide engaging feedback or build motivation. Alex struggles to understand fitness
    terminology and is unsure if his training is balanced, leading to a fear of developing imbalances or injuring himself by overdoing
    certain exercises. Additionally, he prefers features that fit into busy, irregular schedules and offer clear visual rewards. 
    He needs an intuitive, encouraging, and gamified guide to help him build a foundation.

* Diego, the Competitive Gamer:
  ** Background and daily habits:
    Diego is a 22-year-old computer science student from San Juan, Puerto Rico. He spends much of his free time gaming, streaming, or
    coding with friends online. He loves competitive environments and progression systems, whether it’s climbing ranked ladders in his
    favorite games or improving his game stats. Outside of gaming Diego enjoys testing with his friends who have more strength, endurance,
    or who can make the best dish, but he feels weaker than them in physical challenges. 
His feeling of being physically weaker than friends isn't just about gym stats; it's about social confidence and status within his friend group. Looking information online he stumbled across how improving physical strength might also be linked to improving focus for long coding sessions and started to consider going to the gym. 
Although he joined a gym last semester, he quickly
    lost motivation because he doesn’t get the feeling of achieving, often translating to a feeling of wasted time.
  ** Motivations and goals:
    Diego wants a fitness app that makes working out feel like leveling up in a video game. He is motivated by points, rankings, and visual
    progress bars that show him getting stronger in real time. His main goal is to stay consistent by turning workouts into daily “missions”
    that reward effort and let him compete with friends. He also wants to improve his physical strength so he can win physical challenges against his friends.
  ** Pain points and needs:
The app’s competitive elements need to be robust enough to help him earn bragging rights, not just personal points.
Competition against his friends is a major motivator. The app needs highly developed social challenge features, perhaps customizable duels or guild-like team goals, not just a simple leader board.
    Current gym apps feel lifeless to him; they only track sets and reps without giving a sense of reward or excitement. He struggles with
    accountability when training alone and needs an app that transforms progress into a fun, measurable system that keeps him hooked like a
    game. He also wants an app that provides clear, visual indicators of his improvements as if he is improving stats in a game.
His computer science background suggests he is comfortable with technology and likely expects a sophisticated, bug-free, and well-designed interface, not a basic app. 

* Sarah, the Consistent:
  ** Background and daily habits:
    Sarah is a 32 year old teacher from Austin, Texas, who has maintained a regular gym routine for the past two years. She teaches high school
    health and wellness classes, and her curiosity about nutrition, fitness, and exercise science allows her to apply what she learns both in school
    and in her personal life. She is knowledgeable about basic exercises and tracks her sets and reps diligently in a notes app. She enjoys the discipline
    of training and typically works out early in the morning before school to maintain consistency. Outside the gym and school, Sarah enjoys reading about
    nutrition and wellness, trying out new healthy recipes, and occasionally attending local fitness classes to expand her knowledge. As a busy teacher, time is precious and likes to plan ahead during the week. She secretly allows
    herself a cheat day every two weeks, indulging in foods like Burger King or fully loaded pizzas. As a health teacher, hitting a plateau has been slightly embarrassing or frustrating for Sarah because she feels she "should" know better. She suspects she may be neglecting certain muscle groups but lacks the data to confirm it.
  ** Motivations and goals:
Her goal isn't just about lifting heavier weights; it's about a continuous quest for knowledge and mastery of health and wellness.
    Sarah wants to optimize her training to overcome her current progress plateau. She is motivated by measurable results and personal challenges,
    using data to track improvements and hold herself accountable. Her main goal is to ensure balanced development across all muscle groups while adding a new layer of challenge and enjoyment to her well-established fitness routine, beyond simply lifting heavier weights.
 ** Pain points and needs:
    Sarah has hit a progress plateau and feels her workouts have become repetitive. She suspects she may be neglecting certain muscle groups
    but lacks the data to confirm it. Her current tracking method is fragmented and offers no actionable insights. She finds most fitness apps
    too simplistic and not designed for someone with her experience and discipline. She needs a tool that provides detailed, data driven analytics
    on her performance and muscle development.
Her structured schedule suggests the need for features that allow for advanced planning, such as a robust weekly or monthly workout scheduler that can send calendar reminders to her work schedule.

* Marcos, the Motivator:
  ** Background and daily habits:
    Marcos is a 24-year-old graduate student from Chicago, Illinois, who treats fitness as a social activity. He works out with a close-knit
    group of friends, relying on their presence for accountability and friendly competition. Marcos and his friends constantly challenge
    each other to show up and push harder. He often shares workout milestones on social media like, Instagram but wishes there were a more
    integrated way to track his progress and stay connected with his friends’ achievements. Outside the gym, Marcos balances his studies, 
    part-time tutoring, and social life. He enjoys attending local fitness events, trying new workout classes, and exploring healthy restaurants
    with friends. He is curious about sports science and occasionally reads articles on training techniques and recovery methods. Although
    disciplined, he sometimes struggles to stay consistent when friends are unavailable or during particularly busy weeks, which makes him
    value social accountability even more. Marcos also enjoys mentoring others in fitness and often motivates classmates or peers to adopt
    healthier habits. He sees exercise not just as a personal goal but as a way to connect with others, challenge himself, and maintain
    a sense of structure in his life.

  ** Motivations and goals:
    Marcos primary motivation is community, accountability, and shared achievement. He wants an app that strengthens his workout group’s
    connection by making it easy to share progress, celebrate each other’s accomplishments, and maintain streaks together. He thrives in
    a positive, friendly competitive environment that emphasizes consistency and effort rather than solely focusing on raw strength.
    Beyond personal improvement, Marcos also wants to inspire and motivate others, helping peers adopt healthier habits while enjoying
    a sense of community and shared challenge.
  ** Pain points and needs:
    Marcos already uses Instagram for sharing. The app needs highly polished, shareable visual summaries of achievements that are optimized for social platforms, leveraging his habit to attract new users and enhance existing engagement. There is no seamless way to create a private leaderboard with just his friends to track consistency, celebrate milestones, and encourage each other. He struggles to stay motivated when his workout group is unavailable and wants a platform that fosters a small, supportive community centred around collective growth. The pain of friends being unavailable isn't just about missing a workout; it’s about feeling isolated. Mentoring others in fitness gives Marcos a sense of purpose. The app could integrate a "mentor mode" or a public "coach profile" where he can track the progress of those he mentors, reinforcing his role as a leader and motivator. His focus on positive competition and motivation suggests that gamification should prioritize "praise" and "high-fives" alongside raw ranking data. Features might include a robust set of positive reaction emojis or automated encouragement messages.
