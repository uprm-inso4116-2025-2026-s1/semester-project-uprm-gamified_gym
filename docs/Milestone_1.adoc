==== 2.1.6 Function Signatures

* In the context of this project, these signatures capture the 
essential domain operations like creating exercises, starting 
and ending workouts, logging sets, awarding achievements, and 
updating user profiles.

* These are concise pseudo-code definitions that outline the 
function's name, the expected input parameters (exercises, 
sets, repetitions, etc.) and the output with their return type. 
They don't describe the internal logic of the function, they 
just define how different parts will interact in the system.

* These signatures are the blueprint of the system's capabilities
that developers and non-developers alike can understand. This helps
us show how abstract requirements are translated into easy to understand
that can be later implemented in code. These functions bridge the gap 
between conceptual design and actual implementation and working software,
like explaining a complex track workout to a person that doesn't even know
what a track workout is.

createExercise(name: String, sets: Int, reps: Int, duration: DateTime) -> return exercises
// Creates a new exercise with the given name, sets, reps, and duration.

startWorkout(user: User, startTime; Timestamp) -> return WorkoutSession
// Starts a new workout session for the given user at the given start time.

endWorkout(workoutSession: WorkoutSession, endTime: Timestamp) -> return WorkoutSession
// Ends the given workout session at the given end time.

logSet(workoutSession: WorkoutSession, exercise: Exercise, setNumber: Int, reps: Int, weight: Double) -> return Set
// Logs a new set for the given workout session, exercise, set number, reps, and weight.

awardAchievement(user: User, achievement: Achievement) -> return Achievement
// Awards the given achievement to the given user.

calculateExperience(userId: User, setEntry: SetEntry) -> return Experience
// Calculates the experience gained from a logged set based on reps, weight, or duration.

updateUserProfile(user: User, name: String, age: Int, gender: String, height: Double, weight: Double) -> return User
// Updates the given user's profile with the given name, age, gender, height, and weight.

getLeaderboard(period: Timeframe, limit: int) -> return List<LeaderboardEntry
// Return the top users ranked by experience in the given time period.

sendFriendRequest(senderId: User, receiverId: User) -> return FriendRequest
// Creates a pending friend request from one user to another.

acceptFriendRequest(requestId: FriendRequest) -> return Friendship
// Accepts a pending friend request and establishes a friendship connection.

logChallengeProgress(userId: User, challengeId: Challenge, progress: Int) -> return ChallengeProgress
// Logs the progress of a user in a challenge.

awardMedal(userId: User, medal: Medal) -> return Medal
// Awards the given medal to the given user.

createPost(userId User, title: String (not required), content: String, workoutId: WorkoutSession, media: List<MediaFile> (not required)) -> return Post
// Creates a new post with the given title, content, media, and workout session.

createWorkout(userId User, name: String, exercises: List<Exercise>) -> return WorkoutSession
// Creates a new workout session for the given user with the given name and exercises.

=== 2.2 Requirements

==== 2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features

==== 2.2.2 Personas

==== 2.2.3 Domain Requirements

==== 2.2.4 Interface Requirements

==== 2.2.5 Machine Requirements
* The system shall maintain an average response time of no more than 2 seconds for user interactions, such as updating activity data under normal operating conditions. In the event of a search query, the system shall provide results within 4 seconds, even during peak usage.
* The system shall run under normal conditions, when  concurrently running 300 normal scenarios that all randomly start within a 5 minute interval. Beyond this threshold, the system shall gracefully degrade its performance, prioritizing essential functionalities such as the viewing and submission of available products. 
* The system shall gracefully handle an increase when  concurrently running 100 normal scenarios at any given time by dynamically allocating resources. Beyond this threshold, new user connections shall be queued, and the system shall restrict additional connections until resources become available. 
* Machine requirements shall be updated as the project progresses. The previously presented numbers are estimates that are in line with good practice but can only be verified through testing not yet performed. Additional requirements are currently under development, and specific criteria for system stability, acceptable degradation of services, and detailed circumstances for heavily loaded conditions will be researched and defined in subsequent project phases.
