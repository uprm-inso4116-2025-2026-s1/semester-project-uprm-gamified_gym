=== 1.2 Current Situation, Needs, Ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation

  The fitness application market is saturated with products that solely focus on data logging. Many users, particularly 
novices and those who struggle with commitment, are prone to finding these apps mundane. These applications act more as 
glorified digital notebooks rather than actual services for assistance in users' fitness efforts. The lack of engagement 
leads to low user retention, especially with those who already have trouble starting or sticking with their fitness 
journey. Additionally, without visual feedback on users' overall training ditribution, it is easy for users to favor 
certain muscle groups over others (i.e Focus on chest and arms while neglecting legs and back). This would then lead 
to uneven physical development and increased risk of injuries.

=== 1.2.2 Needs

People committed to fitness training need:

* An experience that promotes consistency, effort, and varied workouts to reduce repetitiveness.

* A clear visual regarding their progress beyond simple numbers and statistics to better convey their improvements over time.

* To know the importance of maintaining a balanced training regiment and understand how to maintain this balance across all muscle groups for uniform fitness and reduced injury risks. 

* A structured platform in which they will be able to compare efforts with their peers to foster accountability and commitment.

==== 1.2.3 Ideas

To satisfy the above-mentioned needs, the following ideas for a system-to-be were developed:

* Implement a Gamified Progress System where users earn experience points (XP) for logging their workouts and unlock achievements and badges for challenging milestones. (i.e "1st Week Completed" or "I Can Bench Press Myself!").

* Introduce a Muscle Group Progress tracker (i.e bronze, silver, gold, platinum tier, etc.) that showcases how much effort users are putting into each group.

* Provide a Dashboard with charts that display training frequency and volume of work put into the different muscle groups in order to highlight strongpoints and weakpoints in routines.

* Introduce a Friends page that provides users with the means to connect with friends or even rivals to compare progress, streaks, and achievements to promote accountability and competition.

=== 1.3 Scope, Span, and Synopsis

==== 1.3.1 Scope and Span

  The project operates in the realm of personal fitness tracking, motivation, and community building. It will provide 
the means for users to prepare and log their own workout routines alongside a vast list of known exercises that are 
coupled with visual aids to understand what muscle groups are being worked. Additionally, it will utilize the statistics 
obtained from the users' logs in order to create and update graphs that keep them updated on their progress. It will 
also go beyond other competitor applications by introducing gamey aspects that promote commitment and dedication to 
the users' fitness journeys.

  To establish a proper foundation, the project will begin by identifying critical stakeholders, such as potential 
users in need of a good start to their fitness journey or more experienced gym-goers that wish for a more playful 
alternative to the often repetitive grind of maintining a healthy and fit body. Upon Analyzing their behaviour and 
needs, a larger domain representation will be developed. This would allow the team to align the platform to meet their
expectations and provide an optimal user experience. Requirements are to be derived from the stakeholder study and 
further clarified by the development team to ensure the application meets user expectations. The defining of key 
features such as workout logging, internal statistic tracking, and social interactions are part of this process. The 
system will have a guided and intuitive process of logging workouts or viewing statistics by means of dedicated pages 
for the features that are coupled with search items and sorting capabilities (in the case of viewing or finding 
exercises in such a long list). These aspects are to be managed in the backend as a database of items to be retrieved
on demand. On the other hand, the frontend will consist of a simple, interactive UI that promotes engagement and 
exploration of the application.

==== 1.3.2 Synopsis

  Gamified Gym is an android mobile application aimed at improving the fitness tracking experience for gym-goers, 
particularly those who struggle to stay motivated or committed to their fitness journey. The project will cover the 
phases of development, from preliminary domain and design analysis to the deployment of the application. It will be 
built using a React Native frontend and a Supabase backend for a smooth and reliable user experience, using agile 
methodology and features validated through manager and team leader reviews in GitHub and Visual Studio Code. The app 
will centralize workout logging, progress tracking and social interactions bundled with motivational aspects designed 
to engage users and further immerse them into their fitness goals. It will provide consistent updates to graphical 
elements based on user input in order to maintain communication between the user and the service. Furthermore, it 
will involve stakeholder and potential user interviews, requirements gathering, and general interest gathering 
forms to pivot application requirements as needed. The end is to ensure the most amount of users are both interested 
and satisfied with the deployed iteration of Gamified Gym.

=== 1.4 Other Activities Than Just Developing Source Code

* Domain Engineering: Researching and documenting fitness principles, common user behaviors, and gamification techniques to ensure the app is effective and safe.

* Requirements Engineering: Eliciting needs from potential users and translating them into detailed software requirements.

* Stakeholder Liaison: Regularly communicating with beta testers and a potential fitness expert partner to gather feedback.

* Software Architecture: Designing the high-level structure of the application, including the frontend-backend interaction and data models.

* Testing: Creating and executing test plans for unit, integration, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

* DevOps: Configuring the build pipeline for React Native and setting up the Supabase project.

=== 1.5 Derived Goals

* Primary Goal: 

 ** To create an engaging and motivating workout-tracking application that helps users maintain consistency, motivation and achieve a balanced physique.

* Secondary Goals:

 ** Educational Value: To subtly educate users on the importance of muscle group balance and progressive overload through the gamification mechanics.

 ** Community Building: To foster a positive and supportive micro-community around fitness, moving away from toxic comparison and towards collective growth.

 ** Technical Proficiency: To successfully implement and integrate a modern technology stack (React Native, Supabase) and demonstrate its effectiveness for building a full-stack mobile application.

== 2. Descriptive part

=== 2.1 Domain description

==== 2.1.1 Domain rough sketch

==== 2.1.2 Terminology

==== 2.1.3 Domain terminology in relation to domain rough sketch

==== 2.1.4 Narrative
In fitness, individuals engage in physical exercise to improve health, 
strength, endurance, or appearance. Workouts are often organized into sets
and repetitions of exercises targeting specific muscle groups such as chest, back,
legs, arms and shoulders. People also measure progress in terms of performance (i.e.
increasing weights lifted or repetitions completed), physical changes or overall 
endurance. 

Despite the availability of many training methods, individuals frequently enncounter
difficulties in staying motivated and consistent. Some rely on notebooks, spreadsheets, or
mental notes to keep track of their routines, while others may depend on general-purpose
fitness apps. These methods record data but rarely provide meaningful feedback. As a result,
people may unknowingly train some muscle groups more than others, leading to imbalances, overtraining,
or plateaus in performance. 

Within gym and fitness culture, motivation is often sustained through external factors
such as competition, social comparison, and personal milestones. For example, athletes celebrate 
when they achieve a new personal best or notice visible physical changes. Similarly, comparing progress
with peers-whether with friends or in competitive settings-has long been part of the fitness experience. 
Additionally, badges, milestones, and challenges exist as a symbol of their achievement, whether
in the form of weightlifting belts, gym awards, or recognition in a community.

Thus, the domain of fitness involves not only the physical act of exercising, but also the human
tendency towards self-improvement, tracking performance, maintaining balance, and seeking motivation 
through challenges. the difficulties arise from the absence of engaging, consistent methods of
feedback and recognition that help individuals sustain long-term progress across different aspects of 
their training.

==== 2.1.5 Events, Actions, and Behaviors

==== 2.1.6 Function Signatures

* In the context of this project, these signatures capture the 
essential domain operations like creating exercises, starting 
and ending workouts, logging sets, awarding achievements, and 
updating user profiles.

* These are concise pseudo-code definitions that outline the 
function's name, the expected input parameters (exercises, 
sets, repetitions, etc.) and the output with their return type. 
They don't describe the internal logic of the function, they 
just define how different parts will interact in the system.

* These signatures are the blueprint of the system's capabilities
that developers and non-developers alike can understand. This helps
us show how abstract requirements are translated into easy to understand
that can be later implemented in code. These functions bridge the gap 
between conceptual design and actual implementation and working software,
like explaining a complex track workout to a person that doesn't even know
what a track workout is.

=== 2.2 Requirements

==== 2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features

This section details the functional and non-functional requirements of the 'Gamified Gym'
system, expressed through user stories and grouped into larger epics. The requirements are
directly derived from the completed work during Milestone 1, as evidenced by the closed
tasks. This approach ensures a direct link between the project's design and its tangible
development progress, including both front-end and back-end work.

=== Epics

For Milestone 1, the team focused on two core epics that lay the foundation for the entire
application.

Epic 1: Foundational Design and User Interface (UI)

  - Goal: To establish a consistent and user-friendly visual and interactive design
    for the application's core pages.
  - Justification: This epic addresses the critical need for a well-structured and
    intuitive user experience from the very start. A solid design foundation is
    necessary for all subsequent feature development.

Epic 2: Core Fitness and Data Management
  
  - Goal: To establish the fundamental data structures and logic required to track and
    manage user workout data.
  - Justification: This epic is the core of the application's value proposition. It
    ensures that the system can accurately handle, store, and process the primary data
    (exercises, workouts, etc.) that the user will interact with, directly supporting
    the app's fitness tracking goals.


=== User Stories and UI Contributions (Derived from Closed Tasks)


The following user stories and their associated UI tasks were completed during Milestone 1.
Each story is mapped to the specific closed issues that contributed to its completion,
demonstrating a clear link between requirements and implementation.

---

User Stories for Epic 1: Foundational Design and UI

---

User Story: User Authentication Page Design

  - Story: As a first-time or returning user, I want to see a clear design for the
    login and sign-up pages, so that I can easily and confidently access my account or
    create a new one.
    
  - UI Contribution: The completion of these tasks provided a cohesive design for the
    entire user authentication flow. The Figma designs ensure a consistent user
    journey across these critical pages, using a defined color palette, typography, and
    layout for a professional feel.

User Story: Core Page Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to see a clear and intuitive layout for the main pages, so
    that I can understand the purpose of each section at a glance.

  - UI Contribution: By designing these pages in Figma and building the base UI shells
    for the Home and Workouts pages, the team established a visual blueprint for the
    application's main interface. This work defined the location of key elements like
    the profile picture, navigation menus, and content feeds, ensuring a logical flow
    and a predictable user experience.

User Story: Gamification Element Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to see visual representations of my progress and
    achievements, so that I can stay motivated to continue my fitness journey.

  - UI Contribution: These design tasks focused on integrating gamification elements
    directly into the UI. The completed Figma pages and designs for the progression
    bar and challenges provide a visual guide for developers to implement these core
    motivational features. The foundational work in defining the XP system
    ensures that the visual elements are backed by clear and consistent logic.

User Story: Post Creation Feature Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to design a way to create and share content, so that I
    can interact with the community.

  - UI Contribution: The Figma design for the post creation feature lays out a
    user-friendly form. It includes placeholders for images and a text input area,
    providing a clear and easy-to-use interface that directly supports content sharing.

---

User Stories for Epic 2: Core Fitness and Data Management

---

User Story: Workout Logging Feature

  - Story: As a user, I want to log a workout with an exercise timer/counter, so that
    I can accurately track my progress and performance.

  - UI Contribution: The UI for the exercise timer and counter
    provides the direct user interaction point for this feature. It includes a visible
    timer, start/stop buttons, and a counter. The completion of the Exercise Detail
    Card Mockup defines how individual exercise information will be displayed.
    The conceptual work and the function signatures provides the foundational logic that the 
    UI will interact with, ensuring the UI's functionality is backed by a robust and 
    well-defined system.

User Story: Data Preparation and Management

  - Story: As the system, I need to manage and access structured exercise data, so
    that I can provide a variety of accurate and consistent workout information to the
    user.

  - UI Contribution: While these tasks are primarily backend-focused, they directly
    enable the UI to function. The data prepared provides the content
    that the UI will display (e.g., exercise names, descriptions, icons). The mock data
    from allows for early-stage UI testing without a live backend, ensuring the
    front-end can be developed and refined in parallel. This shows a deep
    understanding of the inter-team dependencies crucial for project success.

User Story: Backend and API Initialization

  - Story: As the system, I need to establish a connection to a database, so that I
    can persistently store and retrieve user and fitness data.

  - UI Contribution: These foundational tasks are what allow for a dynamic,
    data-driven UI. Without the database initialization and the chosen backend stack,
    UI components like the profile page or workout logs would be static and unable to
    store user information, proving that backend work is the backbone that makes the
    UI functional.

* Media Optimization: All images (e.g., avatars, badges) must be compressed for fast delivery on mobile networks.

===== Error Handling & Feedback
* Error Dialogs: Display clear, non-technical error messages for system issues (e.g., "Could not connect to the server. Please check your internet connection.").
* Positive Feedback: Provide immediate visual confirmation after a user completes a key action.
** Successful Workout Log: A confirmation message or animation (e.g., "Workout Saved!").
** Achievement Unlocked: A celebratory pop-up or notification.
** New Rank Attained: A visually distinct animation celebrating the rank-up.

==== 2.2.5 Machine Requirements
* The system shall maintain an average response time of no more than 2 seconds for user interactions, such as updating activity data under normal operating conditions. In the event of a search query, the system shall provide results within 4 seconds, even during peak usage.
* The system shall run under normal conditions, when  concurrently running 300 normal scenarios that all randomly start within a 5 minute interval. Beyond this threshold, the system shall gracefully degrade its performance, prioritizing essential functionalities such as the viewing and submission of available products. 
* The system shall gracefully handle an increase when  concurrently running 100 normal scenarios at any given time by dynamically allocating resources. Beyond this threshold, new user connections shall be queued, and the system shall restrict additional connections until resources become available. 
* Machine requirements shall be updated as the project progresses. The previously presented numbers are estimates that are in line with good practice but can only be verified through testing not yet performed. Additional requirements are currently under development, and specific criteria for system stability, acceptable degradation of services, and detailed circumstances for heavily loaded conditions will be researched and defined in subsequent project phases. 

=== 2.3 Implementation

==== 2.3.1 Selected Fragments of the Implementation

*The following fragment illustrates the implementation of the **Top Card** component in the `HomeScreen`.  
*The Top Card serves as the initial, user-facing element of the screen. It asks the user *“How are you feeling today?”* and provides a dedicated space (`topCardBody`) for interactive content such as mood tracking, quick inputs, or suggestions.  
*This design:
** Enhances user engagement by creating a personalized greeting and check-in experience.  
** Provides a clear entry point for actions, acting as the first interactive area of the screen.  
** Establishes visual hierarchy, ensuring the user immediately sees what the app prioritizes.  
** Allows future expandability, since more features can be added inside the `topCardBody` without redesigning the layout.  
* Code Fragment
