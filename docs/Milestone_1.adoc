==== 2.1.6 Function Signatures

* In the context of this project, these signatures capture the 
essential domain operations like creating exercises, starting 
and ending workouts, logging sets, awarding achievements, and 
updating user profiles.

* These are concise pseudo-code definitions that outline the 
function's name, the expected input parameters (exercises, 
sets, repetitions, etc.) and the output with their return type. 
They don't describe the internal logic of the function, they 
just define how different parts will interact in the system.

* These signatures are the blueprint of the system's capabilities
that developers and non-developers alike can understand. This helps
us show how abstract requirements are translated into easy to understand
that can be later implemented in code. These functions bridge the gap 
between conceptual design and actual implementation and working software,
like explaining a complex track workout to a person that doesn't even know
what a track workout is.

=== 2.2 Requirements

==== 2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features

This section details the functional and non-functional requirements of the 'Gamified Gym'
system, expressed through user stories and grouped into larger epics. The requirements are
directly derived from the completed work during Milestone 1, as evidenced by the closed
tasks. This approach ensures a direct link between the project's design and its tangible
development progress, including both front-end and back-end work.

=== Epics

For Milestone 1, the team focused on two core epics that lay the foundation for the entire
application.

Epic 1: Foundational Design and User Interface (UI)

  - Goal: To establish a consistent and user-friendly visual and interactive design
    for the application's core pages.
  - Justification: This epic addresses the critical need for a well-structured and
    intuitive user experience from the very start. A solid design foundation is
    necessary for all subsequent feature development.

Epic 2: Core Fitness and Data Management
  
  - Goal: To establish the fundamental data structures and logic required to track and
    manage user workout data.
  - Justification: This epic is the core of the application's value proposition. It
    ensures that the system can accurately handle, store, and process the primary data
    (exercises, workouts, etc.) that the user will interact with, directly supporting
    the app's fitness tracking goals.


=== User Stories and UI Contributions (Derived from Closed Tasks)


The following user stories and their associated UI tasks were completed during Milestone 1.
Each story is mapped to the specific closed issues that contributed to its completion,
demonstrating a clear link between requirements and implementation.

User Stories for Epic 1: Foundational Design and UI

---

User Story: User Authentication Page Design

  - Story: As a first-time or returning user, I want to see a clear design for the
    login and sign-up pages, so that I can easily and confidently access my account or
    create a new one.
  - Related Closed Tasks:
    * Issue 63 Create Figma Design for Login Page
    * Issue 64 Create Figma Design for Signup Page
    * Issue 65 Create Figma Design for Forgot Password Page
    
  - UI Contribution: The completion of these tasks provided a cohesive design for the
    entire user authentication flow. The Figma designs ensure a consistent user
    journey across these critical pages, using a defined color palette, typography, and
    layout for a professional feel.

User Story: Core Page Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to see a clear and intuitive layout for the main pages, so
    that I can understand the purpose of each section at a glance.
  - Related Closed Tasks:
    * Issue 69 Create Figma Design for Profile Page
    * Issue 70 Create Figma Design for Home Page
    * Issue 71 Create Figma Design for Settings Page
    * Issue 50 Build Home Page Screen
    * Issue 81 Workouts Page UI Shell Objective: Create the base Workouts Page layout

  - UI Contribution: By designing these pages in Figma and building the base UI shells
    for the Home and Workouts pages, the team established a visual blueprint for the
    application's main interface. This work defined the location of key elements like
    the profile picture, navigation menus, and content feeds, ensuring a logical flow
    and a predictable user experience.

User Story: Gamification Element Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to see visual representations of my progress and
    achievements, so that I can stay motivated to continue my fitness journey.
  - Related Closed Tasks:
    * Issue 62 Create Design of Page Showcasing Achievements
    * Issue 85 Design Progression Bar (XP/Level System)
    * Issue 88 Define XP System
    * Issue 84 Design Page for Daily/Weekly/Monthly Challenges

  - UI Contribution: These design tasks focused on integrating gamification elements
    directly into the UI. The completed Figma pages and designs for the progression
    bar and challenges provide a visual guide for developers to implement these core
    motivational features. The foundational work in defining the XP system (Issue 88)
    ensures that the visual elements are backed by clear and consistent logic.

User Story: Post Creation Feature Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to design a way to create and share content, so that I
    can interact with the community.
  - Related Closed Tasks:
    * Issue 73 Design Create Post Feature in Figma

  - UI Contribution: The Figma design for the post creation feature lays out a
    user-friendly form. It includes placeholders for images and a text input area,
    providing a clear and easy-to-use interface that directly supports content sharing.

User Stories for Epic 2: Core Fitness and Data Management

---

User Story: Workout Logging Feature

  - Story: As a user, I want to log a workout with an exercise timer/counter, so that
    I can accurately track my progress and performance.
  - Related Closed Tasks:
    * Issue 72 Explain and design Workout Logging feature
    * Issue 97 Exercise Timer / Counter UI
    * Issue 102 Exercise Detail Card Mockup
    * Issue 112 Modeling the Life Cycle of a Workout in a Fitness Tracker
    * Issue 108 Write 2.1.6 Function signatures

  - UI Contribution: The UI for the exercise timer and counter, designed in task Issue 97,
    provides the direct user interaction point for this feature. It includes a visible
    timer, start/stop buttons, and a counter. The completion of the Exercise Detail
    Card Mockup (Issue 102) defines how individual exercise information will be displayed.
    The conceptual work in tasks Issue 72, Issue 112, and the function signatures (Issue 108)
    provides the foundational logic that the UI will interact with, ensuring the UI's
    functionality is backed by a robust and well-defined system.

User Story: Data Preparation and Management

  - Story: As the system, I need to manage and access structured exercise data, so
    that I can provide a variety of accurate and consistent workout information to the
    user.
  - Related Closed Tasks:
    * Issue 82 Prepare exercises data for UI
    * Issue 99 Index Json Files
    * Issue 101 Mock data for exercise logging

  - UI Contribution: While these tasks are primarily backend-focused, they directly
    enable the UI to function. The data prepared in Issue 82 and Issue 99 provides the content
    that the UI will display (e.g., exercise names, descriptions, icons). The mock data
    from Issue 101 allows for early-stage UI testing without a live backend, ensuring the
    front-end can be developed and refined in parallel. This shows a deep
    understanding of the inter-team dependencies crucial for project success.

User Story: Backend and API Initialization

  - Story: As the system, I need to establish a connection to a database, so that I
    can persistently store and retrieve user and fitness data.
  - Related Closed Tasks:
    * Issue 61 Decide backend/database stack
    * Issue 67 Initialize Supabase in the project

  - UI Contribution: These foundational tasks are what allow for a dynamic,
    data-driven UI. Without the database initialization and the chosen backend stack,
    UI components like the profile page or workout logs would be static and unable to
    store user information, proving that backend work is the backbone that makes the
    UI functional.

** Mobile (360x640 and higher): Single-column layout with a bottom navigation bar.
** Tablet (768x1024 and higher): Single or two-column layout with an adaptable navigation menu.
* Touch Interactions: All interactive elements must have sufficiently large tap targets.

===== Consistency
 * A consistent design language must be used throughout the app to ensure a cohesive experience.
** Button Styles: Primary buttons (e.g., "Save Workout") and secondary buttons (e.g., "Cancel") must have distinct, consistent styles.
** Color Palette: Use an energetic and motivating color palette. Specific colors should be designated for achievements (e.g., gold), progress bars, and error states (e.g., red).
** Fonts: Use a consistent and legible font family for all headings, body text, and data points.

===== Performance
* Page Load Optimization: The app must load quickly, especially the workout logging screen, to avoid frustrating users during their workout.
* Media Optimization: All images (e.g., avatars, badges) must be compressed for fast delivery on mobile networks.

===== Error Handling & Feedback
* Error Dialogs: Display clear, non-technical error messages for system issues (e.g., "Could not connect to the server. Please check your internet connection.").
* Positive Feedback: Provide immediate visual confirmation after a user completes a key action.
** Successful Workout Log: A confirmation message or animation (e.g., "Workout Saved!").
** Achievement Unlocked: A celebratory pop-up or notification.
** New Rank Attained: A visually distinct animation celebrating the rank-up.

==== 2.2.5 Machine Requirements
* The system shall maintain an average response time of no more than 2 seconds for user interactions, such as updating activity data under normal operating conditions. In the event of a search query, the system shall provide results within 4 seconds, even during peak usage.
* The system shall run under normal conditions, when  concurrently running 300 normal scenarios that all randomly start within a 5 minute interval. Beyond this threshold, the system shall gracefully degrade its performance, prioritizing essential functionalities such as the viewing and submission of available products. 
* The system shall gracefully handle an increase when  concurrently running 100 normal scenarios at any given time by dynamically allocating resources. Beyond this threshold, new user connections shall be queued, and the system shall restrict additional connections until resources become available. 
* Machine requirements shall be updated as the project progresses. The previously presented numbers are estimates that are in line with good practice but can only be verified through testing not yet performed. Additional requirements are currently under development, and specific criteria for system stability, acceptable degradation of services, and detailed circumstances for heavily loaded conditions will be researched and defined in subsequent project phases.
