=== 1.2 Current Situation, Needs, Ideas

==== 1.2.1 Current Situation

  The fitness application market is saturated with products that solely focus on data logging. Many users, particularly 
novices and those who struggle with commitment, are prone to finding these apps mundane. These applications act more as 
glorified digital notebooks rather than actual services for assistance in users' fitness efforts. The lack of engagement 
leads to low user retention, especially with those who already have trouble starting or sticking with their fitness 
journey. Additionally, without visual feedback on users' overall training ditribution, it is easy for users to favor 
certain muscle groups over others (i.e Focus on chest and arms while neglecting legs and back). This would then lead 
to uneven physical development and increased risk of injuries.

=== 1.2.2 Needs

People committed to fitness training need:

* An experience that promotes consistency, effort, and varied workouts to reduce repetitiveness.

* A clear visual regarding their progress beyond simple numbers and statistics to better convey their improvements over time.

* To know the importance of maintaining a balanced training regiment and understand how to maintain this balance across all muscle groups for uniform fitness and reduced injury risks. 

* A structured platform in which they will be able to compare efforts with their peers to foster accountability and commitment.

==== 1.2.3 Ideas

To satisfy the above-mentioned needs, the following ideas for a system-to-be were developed:

* Implement a Gamified Progress System where users earn experience points (XP) for logging their workouts and unlock achievements and badges for challenging milestones. (i.e "1st Week Completed" or "I Can Bench Press Myself!").

* Introduce a Muscle Group Progress tracker (i.e bronze, silver, gold, platinum tier, etc.) that showcases how much effort users are putting into each group.

* Provide a Dashboard with charts that display training frequency and volume of work put into the different muscle groups in order to highlight strongpoints and weakpoints in routines.

* Introduce a Friends page that provides users with the means to connect with friends or even rivals to compare progress, streaks, and achievements to promote accountability and competition.

=== 1.3 Scope, Span, and Synopsis

==== 1.3.1 Scope and Span

  The project operates in the realm of personal fitness tracking, motivation, and community building. It will provide 
the means for users to prepare and log their own workout routines alongside a vast list of known exercises that are 
coupled with visual aids to understand what muscle groups are being worked. Additionally, it will utilize the statistics 
obtained from the users' logs in order to create and update graphs that keep them updated on their progress. It will 
also go beyond other competitor applications by introducing gamey aspects that promote commitment and dedication to 
the users' fitness journeys.

  To establish a proper foundation, the project will begin by identifying critical stakeholders, such as potential 
users in need of a good start to their fitness journey or more experienced gym-goers that wish for a more playful 
alternative to the often repetitive grind of maintining a healthy and fit body. Upon Analyzing their behaviour and 
needs, a larger domain representation will be developed. This would allow the team to align the platform to meet their
expectations and provide an optimal user experience. Requirements are to be derived from the stakeholder study and 
further clarified by the development team to ensure the application meets user expectations. The defining of key 
features such as workout logging, internal statistic tracking, and social interactions are part of this process. The 
system will have a guided and intuitive process of logging workouts or viewing statistics by means of dedicated pages 
for the features that are coupled with search items and sorting capabilities (in the case of viewing or finding 
exercises in such a long list). These aspects are to be managed in the backend as a database of items to be retrieved
on demand. On the other hand, the frontend will consist of a simple, interactive UI that promotes engagement and 
exploration of the application.

==== 1.3.2 Synopsis

  Gamified Gym is an android mobile application aimed at improving the fitness tracking experience for gym-goers, 
particularly those who struggle to stay motivated or committed to their fitness journey. The project will cover the 
phases of development, from preliminary domain and design analysis to the deployment of the application. It will be 
built using a React Native frontend and a Supabase backend for a smooth and reliable user experience, using agile 
methodology and features validated through manager and team leader reviews in GitHub and Visual Studio Code. The app 
will centralize workout logging, progress tracking and social interactions bundled with motivational aspects designed 
to engage users and further immerse them into their fitness goals. It will provide consistent updates to graphical 
elements based on user input in order to maintain communication between the user and the service. Furthermore, it 
will involve stakeholder and potential user interviews, requirements gathering, and general interest gathering 
forms to pivot application requirements as needed. The end is to ensure the most amount of users are both interested 
and satisfied with the deployed iteration of Gamified Gym.

==== 2.1.4 Narrative
In fitness, individuals engage in physical exercise to improve health, 
strength, endurance, or appearance. Workouts are often organized into sets
and repetitions of exercises targeting specific muscle groups such as chest, back,
legs, arms and shoulders. People also measure progress in terms of performance (i.e.
increasing weights lifted or repetitions completed), physical changes or overall 
endurance. 

Despite the availability of many training methods, individuals frequently enncounter
difficulties in staying motivated and consistent. Some rely on notebooks, spreadsheets, or
mental notes to keep track of their routines, while others may depend on general-purpose
fitness apps. These methods record data but rarely provide meaningful feedback. As a result,
people may unknowingly train some muscle groups more than others, leading to imbalances, overtraining,
or plateaus in performance. 

Within gym and fitness culture, motivation is often sustained through external factors
such as competition, social comparison, and personal milestones. For example, athletes celebrate 
when they achieve a new personal best or notice visible physical changes. Similarly, comparing progress
with peers-whether with friends or in competitive settings-has long been part of the fitness experience. 
Additionally, badges, milestones, and challenges exist as a symbol of their achievement, whether
in the form of weightlifting belts, gym awards, or recognition in a community.

Thus, the domain of fitness involves not only the physical act of exercising, but also the human
tendency towards self-improvement, tracking performance, maintaining balance, and seeking motivation 
through challenges. the difficulties arise from the absence of engaging, consistent methods of
feedback and recognition that help individuals sustain long-term progress across different aspects of 
their training.


==== 2.1.5 Events, Actions, and Behaviors
1. Overview
* In fitness, people engage in structured exercises to improve strength,
endurance, and overall health. Understanding the difference between events, 
actions, and behaviors helps clarify how individuals interact with the fitness 
process over time. These distinctions highlight the milestones that occur during 
training, the steps people take to achieve them, and the broader routines and patterns 
that emerge in pursuit of fitness goals.

2. Key Terminologies
* *Event:* A significant occurrence in the fitness journey that marks a milestone or state change.
* *Action:* A specific activity performed by the individual in relation to an event.
* *Behavior:* The overall pattern of repeated actions that make up a fitness routine or
progression path.
** For example, achieving a new personal best in weightlifting is an *event*. The *actions*
leading up to it include performing sets, increasing weights gradually, and tracking
results. The *behavior* is the long-term commitment to progressive overload and consistent training.

3. Application in Gamified Gym
* *Events: Key Fitness Milestones:* Events in the domain of fitness represent meaningful achievements or turning points, such 
as:
  ** Beginning a workout session.
  ** Completing a workout targeting a specific muscle group.
  ** Achieving a personal best in weight, repetitions, or endurance.
  ** Reaching a new performance tier (e.g., first time benching one’s body weight).
  ** Maintaining consistency over a defined period (e.g., exercising three times per week 
  for a month).

* *Actions: Steps in Fitness Process:* Actions are the concrete steps individuals take in their training journey. In the fitness 
context, these include:
  ** Choosing a workout plan or exercise.
  ** Performing sets and repetitions.
  ** Recording weights used for each set.
  ** Tracking rest periods between exercises.
  ** Adjusting training loads to match progress.
  ** Measuring physical results (e.g., strength gains,
  endurance improvements).
  **Comparing progress with peers or training partners.

Each action contributes to building toward larger events, such as hitting new milestones 
or maintaining balanced progress.

* *Behavior: The Training Journey:* Behavior refers to the recurring, long-term patterns of training and progression. The 
fitness journey can be described in these phases:
  ** Initiation Phase: The individual starts a training routine, often motivated by goals such as improved 
  health, strength, or appearance.
  ** Development Phase: The individual consistently trains, records progress, and adapts routines. This stage 
  involves refining technique and gradually increasing intensity.
  ** Achievement Phase: Significant events occur, such as personal bests, visible improvements, or reaching a 
  fitness benchmark.
  ** Sustainment Phase: The individual maintains habits, focuses on balance across muscle groups, and avoids 
  overtraining by adhering to consistent routines.

This sequence of actions and events illustrates how behaviors develop into a continuous fitness 
lifestyle rather than isolated workout sessions.


==== 2.1.6 Function Signatures

* In the context of this project, these signatures capture the 
essential domain operations like creating exercises, starting 
and ending workouts, logging sets, awarding achievements, and 
updating user profiles.

* These are concise pseudo-code definitions that outline the 
function's name, the expected input parameters (exercises, 
sets, repetitions, etc.) and the output with their return type. 
They don't describe the internal logic of the function, they 
just define how different parts will interact in the system.

* These signatures are the blueprint of the system's capabilities
that developers and non-developers alike can understand. This helps
us show how abstract requirements are translated into easy to understand
that can be later implemented in code. These functions bridge the gap 
between conceptual design and actual implementation and working software,
like explaining a complex track workout to a person that doesn't even know
what a track workout is.

=== 2.2 Requirements

==== 2.2.1 User Stories, Epics, Features

This section details the functional and non-functional requirements of the 'Gamified Gym'
system, expressed through user stories and grouped into larger epics. The requirements are
directly derived from the completed work during Milestone 1, as evidenced by the closed
tasks. This approach ensures a direct link between the project's design and its tangible
development progress, including both front-end and back-end work.

=== Epics

For Milestone 1, the team focused on two core epics that lay the foundation for the entire
application.

Epic 1: Foundational Design and User Interface (UI)

  - Goal: To establish a consistent and user-friendly visual and interactive design
    for the application's core pages.
  - Justification: This epic addresses the critical need for a well-structured and
    intuitive user experience from the very start. A solid design foundation is
    necessary for all subsequent feature development.

Epic 2: Core Fitness and Data Management
  
  - Goal: To establish the fundamental data structures and logic required to track and
    manage user workout data.
  - Justification: This epic is the core of the application's value proposition. It
    ensures that the system can accurately handle, store, and process the primary data
    (exercises, workouts, etc.) that the user will interact with, directly supporting
    the app's fitness tracking goals.


=== User Stories and UI Contributions

The following user stories and their associated UI tasks were completed during Milestone 1.
Each story is mapped to the specific closed issues that contributed to its completion,
demonstrating a clear link between requirements and implementation.

User Stories for Epic 1: Foundational Design and UI

---

User Story: User Authentication Page Design

  - Story: As a first-time or returning user, I want to see a clear design for the
    login and sign-up pages, so that I can easily and confidently access my account or
    create a new one.
    
  - UI Contribution: The completion of these tasks provided a cohesive design for the
    entire user authentication flow. The Figma designs ensure a consistent user
    journey across these critical pages, using a defined color palette, typography, and
    layout for a professional feel.

User Story: Core Page Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to see a clear and intuitive layout for the main pages, so
    that I can understand the purpose of each section at a glance.

  - UI Contribution: By designing these pages in Figma and building the base UI shells
    for the Home and Workouts pages, the team established a visual blueprint for the
    application's main interface. This work defined the location of key elements like
    the profile picture, navigation menus, and content feeds, ensuring a logical flow
    and a predictable user experience.

User Story: Gamification Element Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to see visual representations of my progress and
    achievements, so that I can stay motivated to continue my fitness journey.

  - UI Contribution: These design tasks focused on integrating gamification elements
    directly into the UI. The completed Figma pages and designs for the progression
    bar and challenges provide a visual guide for developers to implement these core
    motivational features. The foundational work in defining the XP system
    ensures that the visual elements are backed by clear and consistent logic.

User Story: Post Creation Feature Design

  - Story: As a user, I want to design a way to create and share content, so that I
    can interact with the community.

  - UI Contribution: The Figma design for the post creation feature lays out a
    user-friendly form. It includes placeholders for images and a text input area,
    providing a clear and easy-to-use interface that directly supports content sharing.

---

User Stories for Epic 2: Core Fitness and Data Management

---

User Story: Workout Logging Feature

  - Story: As a user, I want to log a workout with an exercise timer/counter, so that
    I can accurately track my progress and performance.

  - UI Contribution: The UI for the exercise timer and counter
    provides the direct user interaction point for this feature. It includes a visible
    timer, start/stop buttons, and a counter. The completion of the Exercise Detail
    Card Mockup defines how individual exercise information will be displayed.
    The conceptual work and the function signatures provides the foundational logic that the 
    UI will interact with, ensuring the UI's functionality is backed by a robust and 
    well-defined system.

User Story: Data Preparation and Management

  - Story: As the system, I need to manage and access structured exercise data, so
    that I can provide a variety of accurate and consistent workout information to the
    user.

  - UI Contribution: While these tasks are primarily backend-focused, they directly
    enable the UI to function. The data prepared provides the content
    that the UI will display (e.g., exercise names, descriptions, icons). The mock data
    from allows for early-stage UI testing without a live backend, ensuring the
    front-end can be developed and refined in parallel. This shows a deep
    understanding of the inter-team dependencies crucial for project success.

User Story: Backend and API Initialization

  - Story: As the system, I need to establish a connection to a database, so that I
    can persistently store and retrieve user and fitness data.

  - UI Contribution: These foundational tasks are what allow for a dynamic,
    data-driven UI. Without the database initialization and the chosen backend stack,
    UI components like the profile page or workout logs would be static and unable to
    store user information, proving that backend work is the backbone that makes the
    UI functional.

* Alex, the Beginner:
 ** Background and daily habits:
    Alex is a 28-year-old office worker from Miami, Florida, new to the world of fitness. 
    He often feels overwhelmed and out of place in the gym, unsure of where to start or if he 
    is making any progress. His primary goal is to build a consistent workout habit to improve 
    his health and energy levels. He has tried a few popular fitness apps but found them to be 
    boring digital notebooks that he quickly forgot to use. He typically listens to high-energy 
    playlists on Spotify during his workouts to stay motivated.

 ** Motivations and goals:
    Alex wants an application that feels more like a game than a chore. He seeks clear, visual 
    proof of his progress and simple guidance to know he's on the right track. His main motivation 
    is to build confidence through small, achievable wins that make the process of getting in shape 
    feel rewarding and less intimidating.

 ** Pain points and needs:
    Current fitness apps only log data but fail to provide engaging feedback or build motivation. 
    He struggles to understand fitness terminology and doesn't know if his training is balanced, leading 
    to a fear of developing imbalances or injuring himself by doing too much of one thing. He needs an 
    intuitive, encouraging, and gamified guide to help him build a foundation.

* Sarah, the Consistent:
 ** Background and daily habits:
    Sarah is a 32-year-old teacher from Austin, Texas, who has maintained a regular gym routine for the 
    past two years. She is knowledgeable about basic exercises and tracks her sets and reps diligently in a 
    notes app. She enjoys the discipline of training but has recently hit a progress plateau and feels her 
    routine becoming repetitive. She suspects she may be neglecting certain muscle groups but lacks the data 
    to confirm it.

 ** Motivations and goals:
    Sarah wants to optimize her training to break through her plateau. She is motivated by data and personal 
    competition. Her goal is to ensure her physique develops in a balanced way and to find a new layer of 
    challenge and fun in her well-established fitness journey beyond just increasing weight.

 ** Pain points and needs:
    Her current method of tracking is fragmented and offers no analysis or insight. She finds existing gamified 
    apps too simplistic and not built for someone with her level of experience. She needs a tool that provides 
    advanced analytics on her training balance and uses sophisticated gamification, like muscle-specific goals, 
    to target her weaknesses and celebrate her strengths.

* Marcos, the Motivator:
 ** Background and daily habits:
    Marco is a 24-year-old graduate student from Chicago, Illinois, who works out with a close-knit group of friends. 
    For him, fitness is a social activity that provides accountability and friendly competition. He and his friends 
    constantly challenge each other to show up and push harder. He uses social media like Instagram to share his 
    workout milestones but wishes there was a more integrated way to connect his fitness progress with his friends.

 ** Motivations and goals:
    Marco's primary motivation is community and shared achievement. He wants to use an app that strengthens his workout 
    group's connection by making it easy to share progress, celebrate each other's accomplishments, and maintain streaks 
    together. He seeks a positive competitive environment that focuses on consistency and effort rather than just raw strength.

 ** Pain points and needs:
    He finds current fitness apps to be isolating experiences; they are designed for individual use with limited, often clunky 
    social features. There is no seamless way to create a private leaderboard with just his friends to compare consistency and 
    encourage each other. He needs a platform that fosters a small community centered around collective growth.

** Sets: A table or dynamic list where users can input individual sets.
** Reps: Numeric input field for each set.
** Weight: Numeric input field for each set (with unit selection like lbs/kg in settings).
* The form should allow users to easily add or remove sets and duplicate previous entries for efficiency.

===== Error Dialog Specifications
* Implement real-time validation to prevent incorrect data submission.
* Error messages must appear adjacent to the relevant input field and clearly state the issue. Examples include:
** "Reps must be a positive number."
** "Please select a muscle group."
** "Weight cannot be negative."
* Accessibility: All error dialogs must be screen reader-compatible and visually distinct (e.g., using red text and an icon).

===== Progression and Visualization
===== Progress Screen
* This screen must provide a comprehensive overview of the user's fitness journey and balance.
* Ranking System Display:
** Visually display the user's current rank (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond) for each major muscle group.
** Each rank must be accompanied by a progress bar showing how close the user is to the next rank.
* Muscle Balance Visualization:
** Include a chart (e.g., radar chart, bar chart) that visually represents the training volume or rank across all muscle groups to help users identify imbalances.
* Gamification Elements:
** An Achievements/Badges section where users can view all earned and locked achievements (e.g., "First 10 Workouts Logged," "Chest Day Champion").
** A dedicated view for tracking workout streaks and personal bests (PBs) for key lifts.

===== User Profile and Settings
===== Profile Page
* The system must provide users with a profile page where they can:
** Edit their username and profile avatar.
** View their complete workout history with options to filter by date or muscle group.
** See a list of their personal bests for major exercises.

===== Settings Page
* The system must offer users toggles and options to adjust:
** Weight Units: A toggle to switch between pounds (lbs) and kilograms (kg).
** Notifications: Toggles for workout reminders, streak warnings, and social notifications.
** Theme: Options for light or dark mode.

===== General System Requirements
===== Responsiveness
 * The interface must be fully responsive and optimized for a mobile-first experience, with support for tablet and desktop screen sizes.
** Mobile (360x640 and higher): Single-column layout with a bottom navigation bar.
** Tablet (768x1024 and higher): Single or two-column layout with an adaptable navigation menu.
* Touch Interactions: All interactive elements must have sufficiently large tap targets.

===== Consistency
 * A consistent design language must be used throughout the app to ensure a cohesive experience.
** Button Styles: Primary buttons (e.g., "Save Workout") and secondary buttons (e.g., "Cancel") must have distinct, consistent styles.
** Color Palette: Use an energetic and motivating color palette. Specific colors should be designated for achievements (e.g., gold), progress bars, and error states (e.g., red).
** Fonts: Use a consistent and legible font family for all headings, body text, and data points.

===== Performance
* Page Load Optimization: The app must load quickly, especially the workout logging screen, to avoid frustrating users during their workout.
* Media Optimization: All images (e.g., avatars, badges) must be compressed for fast delivery on mobile networks.

===== Error Handling & Feedback
* Error Dialogs: Display clear, non-technical error messages for system issues (e.g., "Could not connect to the server. Please check your internet connection.").
* Positive Feedback: Provide immediate visual confirmation after a user completes a key action.
** Successful Workout Log: A confirmation message or animation (e.g., "Workout Saved!").
** Achievement Unlocked: A celebratory pop-up or notification.
** New Rank Attained: A visually distinct animation celebrating the rank-up.

==== 2.2.5 Machine Requirements
* The system shall maintain an average response time of no more than 2 seconds for user interactions, such as updating activity data under normal operating conditions. In the event of a search query, the system shall provide results within 4 seconds, even during peak usage.
* The system shall run under normal conditions, when  concurrently running 300 normal scenarios that all randomly start within a 5 minute interval. Beyond this threshold, the system shall gracefully degrade its performance, prioritizing essential functionalities such as the viewing and submission of available products. 
* The system shall gracefully handle an increase when  concurrently running 100 normal scenarios at any given time by dynamically allocating resources. Beyond this threshold, new user connections shall be queued, and the system shall restrict additional connections until resources become available. 
* Machine requirements shall be updated as the project progresses. The previously presented numbers are estimates that are in line with good practice but can only be verified through testing not yet performed. Additional requirements are currently under development, and specific criteria for system stability, acceptable degradation of services, and detailed circumstances for heavily loaded conditions will be researched and defined in subsequent project phases. 

=== 2.3 Implementation

==== 2.3.1 Selected Fragments of the Implementation

*The following fragment illustrates the implementation of the **Top Card** component in the `HomeScreen`.  
*The Top Card serves as the initial, user-facing element of the screen. It asks the user *“How are you feeling today?”* and provides a dedicated space (`topCardBody`) for interactive content such as mood tracking, quick inputs, or suggestions.  
*This design:
** Enhances user engagement by creating a personalized greeting and check-in experience.  
** Provides a clear entry point for actions, acting as the first interactive area of the screen.  
** Establishes visual hierarchy, ensuring the user immediately sees what the app prioritizes.  
** Allows future expandability, since more features can be added inside the `topCardBody` without redesigning the layout.  
* Code Fragment
