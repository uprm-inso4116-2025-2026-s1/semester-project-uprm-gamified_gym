*Introduction:*

____
This document presents the initial domain model for the _Gamified Gym_
project. Based on the lecture _Putting the Domain Model to Work_, a
domain model is a simplified, structured representation of reality that
organizes knowledge, reduces complexity, and provides a shared language
for the team. It serves as a blueprint that ensures our implementation
remains consistent with the project’s conceptual foundation.

=== Reflection 

____
Starting with a domain model ensures the project begins with clarity. It
provides a map of what the app will include and how the pieces fit
together, which reduces confusion and improves communication within the
team. As development continues, this model will guide implementation
decisions and help keep the software aligned with the real-world needs
of users.
