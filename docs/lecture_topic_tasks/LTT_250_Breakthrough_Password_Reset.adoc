== [Lecture Topic Task] Breakthrough Applied to Improve the Password Reset Flow in Gamified Gym 

=== Applying “Breakthrough” to Refine the Password Reset Flow in Gamified Gym 

____
The lecture “Breakthrough” explains that software design often evolves
through moments where the team steps back, re-examines the domain, and
finds a clearer, simpler, more powerful way to represent it. These
breakthroughs eliminate accidental complexity, reveal hidden structure,
and allow the model to better match the domain’s true behavior.

In the Gamified Gym mobile application, the password reset
feature—handled through Supabase’s resetPasswordForEmail()
function—appears simple from a UI perspective. However, once examined
through the lens of the Breakthrough lecture, it becomes evident that
the flow contains hidden concepts, blurred responsibilities, and
opportunities for improvement.

This LTT applies the lecture’s ideas to produce a clearer, more
domain-centered design for the password reset feature.
____

=== Understanding the Original Password Reset Flow 

____
The current reset workflow includes:
____

* A React Native screen where the user enters their email
* Validation logic directly inside the UI component
* A Supabase call triggered from the component
* UI state logic mixed with authentication logic
* Error handling embedded directly in the screen
* No representation for a domain concept like “PasswordResetRequest”

____
These characteristics create accidental complexity:
____

* The UI performs too many responsibilities
* Domain concepts are implicit rather than explicit
* The flow can’t be extended without touching UI code
* It’s not easy to reuse the password reset logic elsewhere
* The logic cannot be tested independently

=== Breakthrough Moment: Making the Hidden Concept Explicit 

____
The breakthrough occurs when recognizing that Password Reset is a
**domain behavior**, not a UI action.

This reveals a missing model:

→ **The domain should contain a PasswordResetRequest object**, not just
a UI screen and a Supabase call.

Once this concept becomes explicit, the logic becomes cleaner, testable,
and aligned with the lecture’s principles.
____

=== Proposed Domain Abstraction 

PasswordResetRequest (new concept):

____
class

PasswordResetRequest \{ constructor(email) \{ this.email = email; }

async send() \{

return await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(this.email, \{
redirectTo:

"https://switjvezhwonckihgokh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback",

});

}

}

Why this matches the lecture:
____

* Removes unnecessary complexity from the UI
* Expresses the domain behavior explicitly
* Adopts a cleaner mental model (“request → send → result”)
* Reflects workflow modeling rather than mixing layers
* Creates a conceptual leap forward; a breakthrough

=== UML of the Improved Flow 

____
PasswordResetScreen (UI Layer)

↓ Creates

PasswordResetRequest (Domain Model)

↓ Uses

Supabase Auth Service (Infrastructure)
____

=== Refactored Password Screen Using Breakthrough Principles 

____
const onSubmit = async () => \{ if (!email.includes("@")) \{
alert("Please enter a valid email."); return; } setLoading(true); const
request = new

PasswordResetRequest(email); const \{ error

} = await request.send(); setLoading(false);

if (error) \{ alert("Error: " + error.message);

} else \{ alert("If this email exists, you will receive a reset link.");

}

};

Improvements:
____

* UI now triggers a domain event, not raw logic
* Validation stays clear and isolated
* No hidden Supabase calls inside the screen
* Flow becomes extendable (rate-limiting, audit logging, verification
prompts)
* Fully aligned with Breakthrough’s conceptual simplification

=== The Breakthrough Explained 

____
The breakthrough occurred when recognizing:

**“Password Reset” is not a button. It is a domain process.**

This shift aligns perfectly with the lecture’s message: discovering a
clearer, more coherent model.

Key characteristics:
____

* Reduction of accidental UI complexity
* Emergence of a domain concept
* Clearer boundaries between layers
* Improved maintainability
* Extendability without UI modification

=== Conclusion 

____
Applying “Breakthrough” reveals a superior representation of domain
behavior.

The password reset process becomes:
____

* Explicit
* Organized
* Testable
* Domain-driven
* Extensible

____
This LTT demonstrates how shifting from UI-driven code to domain-driven
modeling elevates the password reset flow into a structured,
maintainable component of the system.
