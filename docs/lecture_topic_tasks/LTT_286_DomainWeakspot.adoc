*Identifying a Weak Spot in the Gamified Gym Domain Model*

The goal of this task, inspired by slides 2-4 of Refactoring Toward
Deeper Insight, is to identify a weak spot in the project’s domain model
– an area where the design feels awkward, incomplete or disconnected.

After reviewing the systems’s key concepts and code structure, I
identified a major weak spot in the relationship between workout
activities and XP progression. While workouts and training sessions
represent the Core Domain of the project and XP progression belongs to
the Supporting Domain, the connection between them in the current model
is vague and fragile. This disconnect can limit how effectively the app
reflects users’ fitness journey.

In the Gamified Gym domain, Workouts are the fundamental unit of user
activity. Each workout consists of multiple exercises, each with its own
parameters (sets, reps). On the other hand, XP is meant to quantify
progress that allows users to level up as they remain consistent with
their exercises. However, in the current design, the XP is not derived
systematically from workout data. Instead, it appears to be assigned
indirectly through functions like _function_updateStreak.js_ or through
milestone triggers in _function_exercise_milestone.js_. These functions
reward completion or consistency, but they do not account for quality,
difficulty, or improvement in the underlying workout itself. This design
creates several conceptual issues:

* The causal relationship between workout performance and XP gain is
unclear.
* There is no explicit domain concept that translates physical effort
into a gamified reward.
* The XP system feels detached from the workout progress, which makes
the game aspect of the project less meaningful.

*Why This is a Weak Spot*

Based on the lecture’s guiding questions, this weak spot reveals
multiple domain modeling issues:

[arabic]
. *A Missing Concept:* +
There is no domain object that represents “Performance Evaluation” or
“Effort Translation.” The system jumps directly from _Workout Completed_
→ _XP Added_ without an intermediate concept that interprets the quality
of performance. +
In domain-driven design terms, this means the *ubiquitous language* of
the app (effort, progress, growth) is missing a core expression.
. *An Imprecise Relationship:* +
The current model treats XP as a side effect rather than a consequence
of training effort. Ideally, XP should be derived from quantifiable
workout metrics — such as volume lifted, intensity zones, or consistency
streaks. +
Without that relationship, the system cannot express why two different
workouts might yield different XP outcomes.
. *Vague Terminology:* +
The meaning of “XP” in the current model is ambiguous — it sometimes
represents *time spent*, sometimes *consistency*, and sometimes
*achievements unlocked*. This inconsistency makes it difficult for both
developers and users to reason about progression.
. *Poor Extensibility:* +
Future features, such as performance-based leaderboards or adaptive
training levels, would not fit naturally into this model because the
system lacks a clear mechanism for comparing effort, intensity, or skill
improvement. +
As a result, adding new progression mechanics would require rewriting
large parts of the gamification logic.

*Brainstorming*

This could be solved with a small brainstorming session with developers
from all teams to clarify the relationship between physical effort and
XP gain. Some discussion points in the brainstrorming session could be
the following:

[arabic]
. How should XP be derived from the training effort of the user
[loweralpha]
.. Possible formula based on volume like (sets * reps * weight)
.. Possible formula based on consistency (effort * consistency)
. How can XP and streak systems coexist without overlapping?
. What should trigger XP gains?
[loweralpha]
.. Should users gain XP after every session or after surpassing
milestones
.. If they gain XP for both, what should give the user more XP?

*Proposed Conceptual Model: Linking Workout and XP progresssion*

To resolve the weak link between Workouts and XP progression, I propose
adding an intermediate concept that translates training effort into XP
in a structured, meaningful way. This creates a clear cause-and-effect
relationship between physical activity and gamified reward. The flow
could look like this.
