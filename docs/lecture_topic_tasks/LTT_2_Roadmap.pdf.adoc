*_Gamified Workout Logger_*

== Phase 1: Planning 

* Goal: Define what we want and need in the app and establish team
structure.
* Identify must-have features (logging, ranking, gamification, charts,
leaderboards).
* Decide whether to build a mobile app, a web app, or both.
* Determine how many teams are needed.
* Assign team leaders and clarify responsibilities.
* Select client framework, backend language, and database.

== Phase 2: Design Flow 

* Goal: Create visual and structural design of the app before
development begins.
* Design a flow chart showing user journey from onboarding to workout
logging.
* Define main parts of the app (logging, ranking system, progress
visualization, leaderboards).
* Sketch wireframes for each screen of the app.
* Create a draft architecture diagram for frontend and backend
integration. - Review flow and structure with all team members for
alignment.

== Phase 3: Core Development 

* Goal: Build the minimal viable product with workout logging and
ranking system.
* Backend Setup: authentication, database schema for workouts, rank
logic.
* Workout Logging Module: input sets/reps/weight + save by muscle group.
* Ranking Engine: Update user rank dynamically as they log workouts. -
Visualization: bar/line charts showing balance across muscle groups.
* Achievements and Badges: initial set of gamified rewards.
* Testing: unit tests + QA for edge cases

== Phase 4: Social Features & Motivation 

* Goal: Add leaderboard and social comparisons. Improve retention
through gamification.
* Leaderboards: compare training volume and ranks with friends.
* Friend System: add/invite friends via username or code.
* Streaks: daily/weekly logging streak system.
* Push notifications: motivational nudges, streak reminders.
* Beta Testing: release to 50-100 users for live feedback. *Phase 5:
Evaluation & Iteration*
* Goal: Measure adoption and refine usability
* Surveys: in-app forms to capture satisfaction and improvement
suggestions.
* Iteration: adjusting ranking balance, badge difficulty, and
leaderboard fairness. - Performance optimization: ensure scalable
backend growth.
