=== Form of Output

*Principle.* The *form of output is not universal* — it depends on the
problem being solved and the

chosen implementation. In Gamified Gym, outputs must make training
effort, balance, and progress

*immediately visible* and *actionable* for users, while also providing
persistent artifacts for social features and longer-term reflection.

*Audiences.*

* Peers/friends: comparable social artifacts (posts, achievements,
leaderboards).
* Team/managers: consistency with design system; verifiable metrics.

*Mediums (implementation-dependent).*

* **Mobile UI views:** cards, lists, modals, toasts, navigation screens.
* **Visual analytics:** using a ranking system.
* **Social artifacts:** post cards, comments, shareable achievements.
* **System feedback:** success toasts, error dialogs, notifications.
* **Data objects (API):** JSON domain entities rendered by the UI.

==== Output Patterns (Problem → Output Form)

* *“Am I progressing?”* → **Workout Summary View** (session totals, XP
gained).
* *“What did I achieve?”* → **Achievement Medal**.
* *“How do I compare?”* → **Friends Leaderboard** (rank).
* *“What should I share?”* → **New Post Card** (title, description,
workout snippet, media).

==== Concrete Output Specifications

**Workout Summary View**

* **When:** After `endWorkout()` or saving a logged session.
* **Form:** Full-screen summary + success toast.
* **Contents:** Date/time, exercises count, total sets/reps, XP gained,
“Share as Post” CTA.
* **Error/edge:** If sync fails, show inline retry + non-blocking toast.

**New Post Card**

* **When:** After `createPost()`.
* **Form:** Feed card.
* **Contents:** Author, timestamp, optional title, content preview (3
lines),description,

*attached workout snippet* (exercises count), media thumbnail strip
(0..4), actions: Like/Comment/Share.

* **Empty states:** If no media, keep layout stable; if no workout (not
allowed by UX), show validation.

**Friends Leaderboard**

* **When:** Viewing social page.
* **Form:** List with sticky header filters (Period: Week/Month/All).
* **Row:** Rank #, avatar, display name, primary metric (XP), secondary
metric (sessions), “View profile” chevron.
* **Empty state:** “No friends yet — add friends to compare.”

**Achievements Output**

* **When:** After `awardAchievement()`.
* **Form:** Celebration toast, and persistent **Profile → Badges** grid.
* **Badge tile:** Icon, tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum/Diamond),
short rule, earned date.
* **Locked tile:** Desaturated icon + hint (“Log 3 leg workouts this
week”).

==== System Feedback & Errors

* **Success toasts:** “Workout saved”, “Achievement unlocked”, “Post
published”.
* **Error dialogs:** Inline + dialog with actionable text (“Reps must be
a positive number.”).
* **Notifications:** Optional reminders (streak risk), social events
(friend request accepted).

==== Consistency Rules

* Use the unified color palette; primary for CTAs, semantic colors for
states.
* All cards use consistent elevation, corner radius, and spacing tokens.
* Text styles: H1/H2 for headers, Body for details, Caption for meta
(time, counts).

==== Example Mappings (Code-friendly)

* `endWorkout()` → Workout Summary View (+ toast, optional Post CTA).
* `createPost()` → New Post Card in feed.
* `awardAchievement()` → Toast + Profile badge grid update.
* `getLeaderboard()` → Leaderboard list with period filters.
* `calculateExperience()` → XP chip in summaries and profile totals.

==== Acceptance Checklist

* [ ] Each core domain problem maps to a concrete output form above.
* [ ] Screens respect color palette, typography, and spacing tokens.
* [ ] Success/error states and empty states are defined for each output.
* [ ] Examples (summary, post card, leaderboard, achievements) are
present in the doc.
