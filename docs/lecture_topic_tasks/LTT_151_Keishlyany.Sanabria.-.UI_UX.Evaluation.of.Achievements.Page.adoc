*UI/UX Evaluation of Achievements Page*

== Evaluation of My Design (Issues #62 and #149) 

* When selecting a specific achievement category, the medals displayed
do not show their respective rank names. This may lead to confusion for
users who want to understand their progress or hierarchy within the
achievements.
* The minimalist design effectively enhances the page’s focus. Requiring
users to click on a category name to reveal the medals helps reduce
visual clutter and keeps the interface clean and organized.
* However, older users may not easily realize that the categories are
clickable. To improve accessibility and usability, an indicator or
visual cue should be added to signal that the categories are
interactive.

== Evaluation of Peer’s Design (Issues #31 and #162) 

* The inclusion of confetti animations upon earning a medal adds a
playful and rewarding element that helps maintain user engagement.
* At first glance, the page design feels overly simplistic, making it
unclear which section of the application the user is currently in.
Adding a page title or header would provide better context and improve
navigation, especially since there is a search bar whose purpose is not
immediately evident.
* Although minor, the inconsistency in the confetti designs slightly
disrupts visual coherence. Ensuring consistent visual elements would
enhance the overall professional appearance of the page. For example,
when elements like buttons, colors, and layouts behave the same way
across the interface, users don’t have to relearn how things work each
time. This reduces cognitive load and makes navigation intuitive.
