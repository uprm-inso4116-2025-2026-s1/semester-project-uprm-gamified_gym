== Chapter 1. Overview

Knowledge crunching is the process of actively engaging domain experts
and technical team members in collaborative learning to build a shared
understanding of the business domain. This task outlines the structured
approach to conducting effective knowledge crunching sessions.

== Chapter 2. Objectives

* Extract tacit domain knowledge from experts
* Build a shared mental model across the team
* Identify key business concepts and rules
* Establish a ubiquitous language
* Uncover hidden complexities and edge cases

== Chapter 3. Participants

=== 3.1. Domain Experts

* Business stakeholders
* Subject matter experts
* End users
* Product owners

=== 3.2. Technical Team

* Software developers
* Business analysts
* Architects
* UX designers

== Chapter 4. Process Steps

=== 4.1. 1. Preparation Phase

==== 4.1.1. Pre-session Activities

* Define session objectives and scope
* Identify and invite relevant participants
* Gather existing documentation
* Prepare questions and scenarios
* Set up collaborative tools

==== 4.1.2. Materials Needed

* Whiteboard or digital collaboration tool
* Sticky notes (physical or digital)
* Documentation templates
* Recording equipment (if applicable)

=== 4.2. 2. Discovery Session

==== 4.2.1. Session Structure

[width="100%",cols="25%,50%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|*Time* |*Activity* |*Duration*
|Opening |Introductions and objectives |10 min
|Exploration |Domain walkthrough and Q&A |45 min
|Break |Coffee break |10 min
|Deep Dive |Complex scenarios and edge cases |30 min
|Synthesis |Key insights and next steps |15 min
|===

==== 4.2.2. Key Questions to Ask

* What does success look like in this domain?
* What are the most common workflows?
* What exceptions or edge cases exist?
* How do you handle errors or failures?
* What business rules are non-negotiable?

=== 4.3. 3. Analysis Phase

==== 4.3.1. Information Processing

* Transcribe and organize session notes
* Identify key concepts and relationships
* Extract business rules and constraints • Map workflows and processes
* Document assumptions and questions

==== 4.3.2. Output Artifacts

* Domain glossary
* Workflow diagrams
* Business rules catalog
* Concept maps
* User stories or scenarios

=== 4.4. 4. Validation Phase

==== 4.4.1. Review and Confirmation

* Share findings with domain experts
* Validate understanding and interpretations
* Clarify ambiguities and gaps
* Refine documentation based on feedback
* Plan follow-up sessions if needed

== Chapter 5. Best Practices

=== 5.1. Do’s

* Keep sessions focused and time-boxed
* Use visual aids and diagrams
* Encourage questions and discussions
* Document everything, even seemingly obvious points
* Follow up promptly with session summaries

=== 5.2. Don’ts

* Don’t assume you understand without confirmation
* Avoid technical jargon with business experts
* Don’t skip validation steps
* Don’t let one person dominate the conversation
* Avoid rushing through complex topics

== Chapter 6. Common Pitfalls

 Watch out for these common issues that can derail knowledge crunching
sessions:

* *Analysis Paralysis*: Getting stuck on perfect documentation instead
of building understanding
* *Expert Unavailability*: Key domain experts being too busy to
participate effectively
* *Language Barriers*: Business and technical teams using different
terminology
* *Scope Creep*: Sessions expanding beyond their intended focus
* *Surface-level Exploration*: Not digging deep enough into complex
scenarios

== Chapter 7. Success Metrics

=== 7.1. Immediate Indicators

* Clear action items and next steps
* Reduced number of clarification questions
* Aligned understanding among participants
* Comprehensive documentation produced

=== 7.2. Long-term Measures

* Decreased development rework
* Improved software-business alignment
* Faster onboarding of new team members
* More accurate project estimates

== Chapter 8. Follow-up Actions

=== 8.1. Documentation Tasks

[arabic]
. Distribute session summary within 24 hours
. Update project documentation with new insights
. Create or refine domain model artifacts
. Log outstanding questions and assumptions

=== 8.2. Ongoing Activities

* Schedule regular knowledge crunching sessions
* Maintain and evolve the ubiquitous language
* Review and update business rules as domain evolves
* Continue building relationships with domain experts

== Chapter 9. Templates and Tools

=== 9.1. Session Template

=== 9.2. Recommended Tools

* *Collaboration*: Miro, Mural, or physical whiteboard
* *Documentation*: Confluence, Notion, or shared documents
* *Diagramming*: Lucidchart, Draw.io, or similar tools
* *Recording*: Zoom, Teams, or audio recording apps

== Chapter 10. Conclusion

Effective knowledge crunching is essential for building software that
truly serves the business domain. By following this structured approach,
teams can systematically extract, analyze, and apply domain knowledge to
create more aligned and effective solutions.

The investment in proper knowledge crunching pays dividends throughout
the development lifecycle, reducing miscommunication, rework, and
ultimately delivering better outcomes for all stakeholders.

_This document should be treated as a living guide and updated based on
team experience and domain evolution._
