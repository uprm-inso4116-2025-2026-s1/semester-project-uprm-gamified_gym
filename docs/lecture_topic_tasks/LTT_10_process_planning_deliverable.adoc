*Gamified Gym: General Process*
____

*Planning Strategy*

== Introduction

The purpose of this document is to define a high-level process planning
strategy for the Gamified Gym project. Since teams have not yet been
divided, this plan outlines the general order of implementation, the
integration strategy to be adopted, and overall guidelines to align
development with milestones.

== Preferred Order of Implementation

To ensure smooth progress and reduce dependency issues, features should
be implemented in the following order:

[arabic]
. *Core Foundations*

____
◦ User authentication (Signup & Login)

◦ Profile creation and basic navigation structure
____

[arabic, start=2]
. *Workout Tracking (Core Functionality)*

____
◦ Exercise library (with categories and images)

◦ Logging of sets, reps, and weights

◦ Storing and retrieving workout history
____

[arabic, start=3]
. *Gamification Features*

____
◦ Badge and achievement system

◦ Milestone tracking (e.g., first workout, streaks, 20 workouts
completed)

◦ Leaderboards or optional challenge system
____

[arabic, start=4]
. *UI/UX Enhancements*

____
◦ Polish for navigation and user feedback

◦ Accessibility features

◦ Responsive adjustments for multiple screen sizes
____

[arabic, start=5]
. *Deployment and Maintenance*

____
◦ Initial deployment to Android devices

◦ CI/CD setup for automated builds

◦ Monitoring, bug fixing, and iterative updates

== Integration Strategy

The recommended integration strategy is *incremental and phased
delivery*:

* *Incremental:* Each major module (authentication, tracking,
gamification) should be integrated as soon as its minimal functionality
is complete.
* *Phased Delivery:* Deliver small usable versions of the app at each
milestone to ensure consistent progress and early feedback.

This approach avoids the risks of a big-bang integration and ensures
that the system grows steadily over time.

== General Guidelines

* Begin with features that are prerequisites for others (e.g.,
authentication before tracking).
* Each milestone should produce a minimally functional product version
that can be tested.
* Dependencies must be clearly documented when assigning future tasks.
* Continuous feedback loops (via SCRUM preps) will ensure the process
plan remains aligned with deadlines.

== Alignment with Milestones

* *Milestone 1 (September 19):* Core authentication and basic navigation
structure ready.
* *Milestone 2 (October 24):* Workout tracking functional with exercise
logging and history.
* *Milestone 3 (November 28):* Gamification features completed, UI
polished, and first deployment.

== Conclusion

This process plan establishes the general roadmap for Gamified Gym
before teams are divided. It emphasizes an incremental approach,
dependency-aware implementation order, and phased delivery to ensure
that each milestone results in a working, testable product.
