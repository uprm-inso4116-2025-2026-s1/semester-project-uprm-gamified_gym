== Objective
Identify and document domain-level constraints that ensure the system’s data and fitness logic remain valid.

== Description

This document formalizes the implicit rules that govern workout behavior in Gamified Gym, making them explicit, traceable, and enforceable. 
Inspired by the lecture “Making Implicit Concepts Explicit,” these constraints serve as domain-level boundaries that protect user safety, maintain realistic workout expectations, preserve fairness in gamified features, and ensure consistent system behavior.

The constraints address areas such as daily time limits, repetition ranges, rest intervals, calorie thresholds, badge eligibility rules, 
challenge participation, and naming or structural rules for routines. Each constraint includes its purpose and the reasoning behind it (safety, fairness, system balance, or user experience). 
The document also clarifies how these constraints interact with aggregates such as User, WorkoutRoutine, Exercise, and Badge.

== Explicit Domain Constraints

=== Safety Constraints
These rules exist to protect the user from unrealistic or unsafe workout behaviors and to ensure the system only processes physically plausible information.

* *Max workout duration of 3 hours per day*: Prevents overtraining and discourages attempts to log unrealistic sessions. *Affects*: WorkoutRoutine, UserProgress.
* *A routine may contain a maximum of 15 exercises*: Ensures manageable workout volume and avoids harmful excess. *Affects*: WorkoutRoutine.
* *Minimum rest interval between sets is 15 seconds*: Reflects natural physiological limitations and avoids unrealistic pacing. *Affects*: Exercise, PerformanceRecord.
* *Daily calorie burn cannot exceed 4000 kcal*: Prevents impossible or manipulated logging values. *Affects*: UserProgress, TrackingSession.

=== Gamification Logic Constraints
These rules protect the fairness and meaning of achievements, streaks, and level progression within the gamified environment.

* *To earn a “Consistency Badge,” the user must meet a minimum of 5 workout days per week.* Ensures the badge reflects sustained activity rather than sporadic sessions.
* *Streak-related badges reset if the user exceeds 3 days of inactivity.* Prevents exploitation and creates meaningful engagement patterns.
* *The “Endurance Badge” requires users to average at least 90 minutes per workout session.* Ensures that badges reflect genuine endurance-based effort.
* *Users may only level up once per day.* Prevents XP farming and protects balance across the leveling system.

=== User Experience Constraints
These constraints improve clarity, prevent confusion, and ensure users interact with meaningful and organized workout content.

* *Workout routine names must be unique per user.* Avoids ambiguity and makes it easier to retrieve and manage routines.
* *Minimum routine duration must be at least 10 minutes.* Ensures routines represent legitimate workout sessions rather than trivial or empty data.
* *Users may join a maximum of 3 active challenges at a time.* Prevents overload and encourages meaningful participation.
* *Repetitions per set must be between 1 and 100.* Ensures input remains within realistic and physically plausible limits.

== Interactions Between Constraints and Aggregates
These constraints shape how aggregates behave and ensure the system remains internally consistent.

* *WorkoutRoutine → Exercise:* Rules such as exercise limits and set repetition constraints apply directly to all 
exercises within a routine. Deleting a routine removes its exercises, ensuring no invalid exercise data persists.
* *User → Badge:* Badge pathways depend on constraint validation. For example, the user cannot earn the “Consistency Badge” unless weekly activity meets the explicit requirement.
* *User → TrackingSession:* Session constraints (duration, calories) must be satisfied before the session contributes to streaks, XP, or challenge progress.
* *Challenge → User:* The limit on active challenges ensures the challenge system remains focused and avoids overwhelming the user.

== Constraint Grouping and Prioritization
* *High Priority – Safety Constraints:*
These directly protect the user’s health and ensure physiologically realistic behavior.
* *Medium Priority – Gamification Constraints:*
These maintain fairness, prevent cheating, and keep the reward system meaningful.
* *Low Priority – User Experience Constraints:*
These enhance clarity, usability, and overall product quality.

== Conclusion
Establishing explicit constraints on workouts provides a solid and reliable foundation for the design of Gamified Gym’s domain model. 
By surfacing and formalizing rules that were previously implicit, the system becomes safer, more predictable, and more aligned with real-world fitness expectations. 
These constraints protect users from unrealistic or harmful behaviors, preserve the integrity of the gamification layer, and ensure that all tracked workouts represent meaningful activity.
Furthermore, defining how each constraint interacts with aggregates such as User, WorkoutRoutine, Exercise, Badge, and Challenge allows the system to maintain coherence as features evolve. 
Clear boundaries prevent edge-case failures, reduce ambiguity during implementation, and support future scalability by keeping the model structurally sound. 
Ultimately, this effort transforms vague assumptions into deliberate domain knowledge. 
It strengthens the ubiquitous language across the team, improves communication, and ensures that both design and development work with a shared understanding of what a “valid workout” truly means inside the platform. 
These explicit constraints will continue guiding new features, balancing user motivation with responsible design, and upholding the core principles of consistency, safety, and meaningful engagement.
