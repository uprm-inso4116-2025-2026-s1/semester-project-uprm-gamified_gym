Domain Concept Distillation and Classification

|===
|Concept |Core Domain |Supporting Domain |Generic/Utility |Reason
|Athlete a|
____
✓
____

| | a|
____
The athlete represents the primary agent of change in the system. All
progress, performance, and gamification outcomes originate from the
athlete’s interactions. Without an

athlete, no training, measurement, or achievement has meaning. The
domain logic must revolve around modeling the athlete’s capacity,
performance trends, and development over time.
____

|Exercise a|
____
✓
____

| | |Exercises form the irreducible action units of gym activity. They
carry biomechanical meaning (i.e., which muscles are stressed), training
intensity, and execution technique. The accuracy and expressiveness of
the Exercise model determine how closely the software aligns with
realworld training semantics, which is crucial for legitimacy and
usefulness.

|Workout a|
____
✓
____

| | a|
____
A workout structures exercises into actionable training sessions, giving
purpose and organization to physical effort. Workouts define rhythm,
load pattern, and session level intensity. This makes Workouts the
operational expression of
____

| | | | a|
____
athletic intent, shaping the daily behavior of the user.
____

a|
____
Routine
____

a|
____
✓
____

| | a|
____
Routines introduce temporal progression, encoding how workouts evolve
across days/weeks. They embed training philosophy

(progressive overload, rest scheduling, periodization). This allows the
app to model long term growth, not just isolated sessions, which is
essential for meaningful improvement.
____

|Muscle Group a|
____
✓
____

| | a|
____
Muscle groups provide the structural map of physiological effort
distribution. They ensure training balance, prevent injury, and support
strength symmetry. Representing muscle groups explicitly enables the
system to reason about overuse, load rotation, and progression
targeting, which are key to expert-level training design.
____

|Workout session a|
____
✓
____

| | a|
____
A Workout Session captures the lived, temporal event of training. It is
where real performance data is generated. The system uses Workout
Sessions to derive trends, validate

improvement, detect fatigue, and trigger achievements. It is the central
data source feeding all higher-level interpretation.
____

|Progress Metric | a|
____
✓
____

| a|
____
Progress Metrics translate physical effort into
____

|===

[width="100%",cols="19%,11%,15%,19%,36%",options="header",]
|===
| | | | a|
____
quantifiable signals (reps, weight, duration). Their function is
interpretive: they do not define training, but they make training
measurable, enabling feedback loops and progression evaluation. They
support the Core Domain by providing evidence of change.
____

|Milestone | |✓ | a|
____
Milestones formalize moments of improvement into recognized progress
markers. They turn raw performance data into psychologically meaningful
checkpoints. This helps maintain athlete motivation, but milestones
cannot exist without prior consistent training data hence, they support
rather than define behavior.
____

|Achievement | |✓ | a|
____
Achievements introduce extrinsic motivation reinforcement, framing
progress in terms of reward and recognition. They depend on training
outcomes, but they influence continued participation. They are
strategically important for engagement but secondary to the training
domain itself.
____

|Progress Tracking | |✓ | a|
____
Progress Tracking is an evaluative layer, converting session data into
trends and insights. It enhances the athlete’s understanding of their
development, but the actual transformation occurs
____

|===

[width="100%",cols="19%,11%,15%,19%,36%",options="header",]
|===
| | | | a|
____
in training, not tracking. Thus, it is supportive rather than
foundational.
____

|Milestone Recognition | |✓ | a|
____
Milestone Recognition is a trigger mechanism that interprets progress
data using predefined thresholds. It formalizes improvement into
user-visible events. It reinforces motivation but depends entirely on
preexisting workout and performance data, placing it in a supporting
role.
____

a|
Achievement

Unlocked Event

| |✓ | a|
____
This event is part of the gamification feedback loop that rewards
consistency and improvement. It strengthens habit formation through
psychological reinforcement, but it does not generate new athletic
capability— therefore, it supports rather than defines the training
domain.
____

a|
____
Overtraining
____

Warning Event

| |✓ | a|
____
This event acts as a safety constraint, preventing negative training
outcomes by evaluating frequency and muscle group stress patterns. It
protects core training integrity but does not execute or define training
actions, positioning it as a supporting safeguard.
____

|App User | | |✓ a|
____
Represents the system-level identity of an individual, independent of
athletic meaning. It is required for authentication and
____

| | | | a|
____
authorization but carries no training semantics.
____

a|
____
Profile
____

| | a|
____
✓
____

a|
____
Stores personal and fitnessrelated metadata. It provides persistence but
does not contribute to the decisionmaking logic of training or progress
interpretation.
____

a|
____
Notification
____

| | a|
____
✓
____

a|
____
A communication mechanism used to deliver system feedback. It functions
purely at the UI/system layer and carries no domain decision logic,
making it a generic utility concern.
