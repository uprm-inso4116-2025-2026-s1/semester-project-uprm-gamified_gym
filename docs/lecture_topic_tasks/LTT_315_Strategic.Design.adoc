*Strategic Design: Mapping Subdomains of the Gamified Gym App*

For this Lecture Topic Task, I reflected on the ideas from the Strategic
Design lecture and applied them to our Gamified Gym project. Even though
the project is ending this week, I wanted to take a step back and think
about how our system fits into Core, Supporting, and Generic subdomains,
and how this type of thinking helps organize a complex system.

== My Understanding of Strategic Design 

Strategic Design is about structuring a large system so the model does
not become one big confusing mess. The lecture explains that as a system
grows in complexity, we need techniques that help us break it into
understandable and manageable parts. If we try to force everything into
a single unified model, we end up with duplication, contradictions, or
random inconsistencies. The goal is to prevent a “monolithic model” and
instead divide the system into subdomains that each have a clear
purpose.

A few key ideas from the lecture stood out to me.

=== Bounded Contexts 

A bounded context is a clearly defined area of the system where a
specific model, vocabulary, and set of rules apply. Inside that
boundary, the concepts must be consistent. Outside that boundary, other
teams or parts of the system can use a different model without creating
conflicts. Bounded contexts reduce the mental load of understanding the
entire project at once.

=== Core Domain 

The core domain is the heart of the system. It is the part of the model
that brings the most value and makes the project unique. The lecture
calls this the part that deserves the most attention, refinement, and
clarity since it represents what the system is really about.

=== Supporting Subdomains 

Supporting subdomains contain logic that is important for the system to
work, but they do not represent its unique or most valuable part. These
areas assist the core domain. They may involve domain logic but do not
define the purpose of the system.

=== Generic Subdomains 

Generic subdomains are areas of the system that are not specific to the
business domain at all. These are things that almost every app needs,
such as authentication, file storage, navigation frameworks, or payment
processing. They provide necessary functionality but do not define the
identity of the product. Because they are generic, they can often be
handled with libraries, frameworks, or standard solutions instead of
heavy modeling.

== Subdomains in the Gamified Gym App 

Based on what we built, I identified three clear subdomains in our app:
Exercise Tracking, Workout Session Editing, and
Authentication/Sign-up/Login.

=== Exercise Tracking (Core Domain) 

This is the core domain of our entire project. The primary purpose of
the app is to let users log workouts, track their exercise history, and
see progression over time. This is what makes our system valuable and
different from a regular notes app or a simple list of exercises.
Everything else in the app supports this purpose.

In our code, this subdomain appears in files like EditSessionScreen,
where users can create or update workout sessions, and in the structures
around exercises, sets, and reps. The decisions made here influence
almost every other part of the system, which matches the lecture’s idea
that the core domain deserves the highest design quality and the most
attention.

=== Workout Session Editing (Supporting Subdomain) 

Session editing is closely related to exercise tracking, but it is more
of a supporting subdomain. It focuses on providing the tools and
workflows needed to create clean session data, such as adding exercises,
adjusting sets and reps, removing items, and organizing them in the
right order.

This area contributes to making the core domain work well, but by itself
it is not the main value proposition of the app. It exists to support
the core functionality. It is still important, but not as central as the
actual tracking of workouts and progression.

=== Authentication and Sign-up/Login (Generic Subdomain) 

Authentication is a good example of a generic subdomain. Almost every
modern app needs a way for users to sign up and log in. The logic here
is not unique or specific to the fitness domain. It uses Supabase’s
authentication system, and most of the rules come from that framework
rather than from our domain.

The Strategic Design lecture explains that generic subdomains usually do
not deserve deep modeling effort because they are not where the system
creates value. Authentication fits perfectly into that category.

== Reflection: Why Mapping Subdomains Helps 

Even though our project is ending soon, mapping out the subdomains
helped me understand the structure of the system and how the pieces fit
together. It shows which areas deserve the most attention and
refinement, especially the exercise tracking logic and progression
features, which I consider the true core of the app.

This type of thinking also helps with onboarding. If someone new joined
the team, knowing the difference between the core domain, the supporting
parts, and the generic areas would prevent them from wasting time
polishing something like authentication instead of helping improve the
workout tracking features.

Finally, identifying bounded contexts keeps the model clean. It avoids
mixing unrelated concepts, prevents accidental duplication, and helps
each part of the system stay focused.

Overall, Strategic Design helped me see the bigger picture of our
project, and gave me a clearer understanding of where our domain model
is strongest and where it could grow in the future.
