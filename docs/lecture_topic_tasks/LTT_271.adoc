In the file exerciseStore.js the use ex as shorthand for exercise
degrades the uniformity of our established language. In file workout
_logs.js The function addEntry could be renamed to addWorkoutLog to
establish a stronger uniformity in the naming in this file and to
prevent duplicate concept. In file addWorkout.tsx the use exCount as
shorthand for exercise count degrades the uniformity of our established
language. In the file recent-workout-car.tsx and workout_logs.js present
the signs of a duplicate concept by both files saving workout logs. The
project uses different naming conventions which degrades the uniformity
of the project.
