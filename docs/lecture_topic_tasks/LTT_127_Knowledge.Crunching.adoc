== Knowledge Crunching

This strategy details the ways that we will capture, process, and
combine domain expertise so that the "Gamified Gym" mobile app is
efficient, effective, and user-need aligned.

== 1. Knowledge Sources:

Our sources of evidence shall:

*Domain Experts:* Consultation shall be conducted with fitness trainers
or enthusiastic gym participants to gain insights into effective workout
frameworks, progression indicators, and motivational stimuli.

*Competing Applications and Working Systems:* Competing fitness
applications as well as gamified applications (such as Strava, Nike
Training Club, Zombies, Run!) shall be reviewed to determine industry
standards, working functionality, as well as areas where improvement can
be implemented.

*Target Users:* We would directly draw insights from the targeted
audience, who include the novices, the weekend fitness enthusiasts, as
well as those who need to be motivated, as indicated in the "Project
Idea" report.

=== 2. Learning Activities:

Below activities shall utilized to collect as well as process data:

*User Interviewing and Questionnaires:* Perform systematic questionings
and questionnaires to identify user problems regarding existing fitness
apps, their motivation, as well as the most important feature they need.

*Competitor Analysis Sessions:* Conduct a structured analysis of
competitor apps to analyze their user navigation, gamification
strategies, and exercise tracking features.

*Refinement of the model and team brainstorming*: involve arranging
frequent inter-team meetings that are intended as opportunities to
discuss results, spread out ideas, and incrementally enhance the common
domain model. They're "laboratories of the model" where, very rapidly,
alternative designs are quickly evaluable.

*Prototyping and A/B Testing:* Craft and test minimalist prototypes of
core functionality, such as the ranking mechanism or badge
configuration, with a small group of beta testers in order to gain
preliminary feedback.

=== *3. Objective:* 

The overarching goal here is to systematically reduce the uncertainties
that surround the project, as the lecture term "Second Order Ignorance"
describes. By working repeatedly with the sources themselves, we move
away from ignorance about the things that are unknown to us, to actively
acknowledging and correcting gaps in understanding.

This approach ensures the cultivation of a model that boasts rich
knowledge that goes beyond mere superficial qualities. It will allow for
the establishment of a consistent and motivating experience that
genuinely replicates the real-world conception behind fitness progress
as well as gamification, thus leading to a more effective and compelling
use.
