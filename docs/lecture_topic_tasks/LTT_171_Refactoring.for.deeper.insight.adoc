LTT. Refactoring towards deeper insight

== From shallow tracking to meaningful gameplay in gamified gym 

In game design a “model” is a set of rules, mechanics and systems that
define the game. For example, in gamified gym, this is the fitness
gameplay loop. This idea of a model requires sophisticated design skills
to implement a system that is both engaging to play and supporting of
fitness goals.

== Levels of Refactoring 

We often think of “refactoring” as cleaning up code, making it more
readable or efficient. However, this is refactoring in the small.
Refactoring to have the greatest impact is when we incorporate new
insight/ ideas into our design. These insights must be clear for the
user, so they know what they are doing and more importantly _why_ they
are doing it. For gamified Gym, this means our design process shouldn’t
be rigid and stale. We must follow our learning and development to think
about what truly motivates a person to exercise.

== Common Mistakes with Shallow vs. Deep models 

*The shallow model*: Take the nouns and verbs from fitness. Nouns: reps,
miles, calories. Verbs: count, log, reward.

* This leads to a naïv e design: “Do 10 push-ups, get 100 points”. It’s
superficial and based on a shallow understanding of both motivation and
fitness.

*The deep model:* A deep sheds superficial aspect and gets to the heart
of what matters.

* It expresses the primary concerns of a person trying to get fit:
Mastery, Progression, Identity, Purpose.
* It provides versatility, simplicity, and explanatory power. The
language shifts from “points” to “skills”, “levels,” and “quests” that
the users genuinely connect with.

== Deep model / Supple Design 

Because we are constantly learning and refactoring, our design needs to
be flexible, easy to change and build upon. A rigid, point-only system
is hard to change. If you want to add more features, you add more
points. That’s meaningless and boring. However, a supple/flexible design
lets you open up and experiment leading to a better game with a
feedback- loop: a better model leads to a better game which leads to
better fitness results which finally leads to more insight on how to
keep improving the game.

== Applying Theory 

Shallow Mechanic vs. Deep Mechanic

* Shallow (The “point-only” Tracker) o Mechanic: User runs 1 mile. App
says: “You earned 50 points” o Problem: The “why” is weak. Why 50? What
do points mean? They are abstract, meaningless currency. This leads to
the “So what” effect. The user quickly becomes bored because the
mechanic has no connection to their realworld fitness goals.
* Deep (A meaningful progression system) o Mechanic: User runs 1 mile.
App says: “Your stamina skill has increased to level 5! You are now
ready to undertake the University Path Quest.”

____
o Explanation
____

* It sloughs off the superficial: It replaces the abstract “point” with
a concrete, recognizable game concept: a Skill (stamina)
* It provides explanatory power: Leveling up Stamina explains the
benefit of running. It’s not just a number; it’s a representation of
their growth.
* It creates versatility: This “Stamina” skill can now interact with
other parts of the game. Maybe it gates new quests, unlocks new workout
types (like interval running), or combines with a “Strength” skill to
unlock a “Power” attribute
