Introduction

This section documents the Bounded Context Map for the Gamified Gym
Application, following the principles from Strategic Design
(Schütz-Schmuck). The system is separated into multiple bounded contexts
to avoid a monolithic and contradictory domain model. Each context
contains its own coherent model with explicit integration points.

The documentation includes:

* A clean context map diagram
* Descriptions of each bounded context
* Relationship patterns (Shared Kernel, Customer–Supplier, etc.)
* Boundary definitions (modules, schemas, APIs)
* Rationale connected to large-scale structure & distillation principles

Bounded Context Descriptions

User Identity Context Responsibilities:

* Authentication
* Account creation
* Profile management

Purpose:

Provides canonical user identity data used across all other contexts.

This context forms part of the Shared Kernel, since user IDs and profile
info are universally referenced.

Workout Tracking Context Responsibilities:

* Workout sessions
* Exercise logs
* Sets, reps, weights

Integration:

* Publishes domain events such as WorkoutCompleted. ● Uses User Identity
data for ownership.

Pattern:

Customer–Supplier (Workout → Event Repository)

Nutrition Tracking Context Responsibilities:

* Daily nutrition logs
* Meal entries
* Calorie/macronutrient totals
* Nutrition goals

Integration:

* Publishes domain events such as DailyNutritionGoalReached. ● Uses User
Identity for record ownership.

Pattern:

Customer–Supplier (Nutrition → Event Repository)

Event Repository Context

Responsibilities:

* Storage of all domain events
* Event dispatching
* Integration hub between contexts

Pattern:

Published Language (events form the universal integration messages)

Gamification Context

Responsibilities:

* XP
* Achievements
* Streaks
* Leveling
* Event-driven progression Integration:
* Subscribes to event stream
* Reacts to domain events from Workout & Nutrition Pattern:

Conformist toward the Published Language of domain events.

Rationale (Strategic Design Principles Applied)

Avoiding a Monolithic Model

Separating into bounded contexts prevents:

* duplicate concepts
* inconsistent terminology
* hidden coupling

Distillation

Core game logic (gamification) is distilled into its own context,
enhancing clarity.

Large-Scale Structure

Event-driven integration provides a consistent architectural backbone.

Bounded Context Isolation

Each domain has its own model, terminology, and rules, allowing
independent evolution.
