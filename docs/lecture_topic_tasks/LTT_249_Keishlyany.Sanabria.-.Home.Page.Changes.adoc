== Description 

Following the _Assertions and Conceptual Contours principles_ from the
Supple Design lecture, the Home Page was refactored to make its implicit
assumptions explicit and enforce stable navigation behavior across Home,
Profile, and Exercises pages. Assertions ensure that critical
preconditions (such as a logged-in user or an available navigation
object) are verified at runtime before any operation executes.

== Tasks Completed 

[arabic]
. Identified implicit assumptions
[loweralpha]
.. A user must be logged in before accessing the _Profile_ or
_ExerciseLog_ pages.
.. Navigation operations assume a valid _navigation_ object.
.. The Supabase client must be initialized before any user/session
request.
. Added Assertions
[loweralpha]
.. Implemented a reusable _assert()_ function to enforce runtime checks.
.. Added _checkNavigationInvariants()_ to confirm navigation validity.
.. Added login checks before allowing navigation to restricted areas.
. Defined Preconditions and Postconditions
[loweralpha]
.. *Preconditions*

User must be authenticated to access restricted pages.

____
After logout, _userName_ must be null and navigation restricted.
____
. Implemented Runtime Checks
[loweralpha]
.. Assertions are logged to console and halt execution when violated.
.. Unauthorized navigation attempts trigger a user-facing _Alert_.
. Automated Test Concepts
[loweralpha]
.. In tests, navigation to _ExerciseLog_ should throw or alert when not
logged in.
.. _userName_ should always match Supabase session state (postcondition
check).

== Acceptance Criteria Results (100% Completed) 

* *All Home Page actions have explicit assertions:* _assert()_ and
_checkNavigationInvariants()_ ensure state validity
* *Navigation behaves consistently:* Navigation restricted until user is
authenticated
* *Automated tests confirm conditions:* Pre/postconditions defined for
testing via simulation
* *Stable Boundaries:* The Home Page now clearly defines boundaries
between safe and unsafe states (logged-in vs. anonymous).
* *Meaningful Failures:* If navigation or Supabase are not properly
initialized, errors now occur immediately and descriptively.
* *Reduced Ambiguity:* The navigation logic now conveys its purpose
through explicit checks rather than hidden assumptions.
