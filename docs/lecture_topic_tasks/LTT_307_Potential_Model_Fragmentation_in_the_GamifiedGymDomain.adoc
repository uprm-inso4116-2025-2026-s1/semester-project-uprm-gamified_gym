*Impact on the*

*Gamified Gym*

*Model*

|*Athlete* |Duplicate “Athlete/User” concepts a|
App User (technical) vs. Athlete (domain) may evolve

differently (e.g., game features only attached to one).

|Confusion between gameplay progression and actual fitness tracking =
inconsistent profiles.

|*Exercise* |Conflicting definitions of an exercise |One team may model
Exercise as a single movement; another may treat it as a completed set.
a|
UI/logic mismatch =

errors in achievements, progress calculations, or workout generation.

|*Workout* |Overlapping concepts: Workout vs. Workout Session |Workout
(template) vs. Workout Session (performed activity) may be merged
accidentally. |Analytics and progress tracking become inaccurate;
achievements may unlock incorrectly.

|*Routine* |Separate interpretations of duration and structure |One
model uses days; another uses weeks or cycles. |Fragmented scheduling
logic = routines behave unpredictably across app modules.

|*Muscle Group* |Multiple classification systems a|
Different teams may define groups differently (Chest vs.

Upper Body).

a|
Recommender

system conflicts = users receive unbalanced or conflicting suggestions.

|*Progress Metric* |Diverging metric structures |Some teams use raw
numbers (lbs, reps), others normalized values (difficulty scores).
|Inconsistent progress graphs; achievements unlock incorrectly; database
may become inconsistent.

|*Achievement* a|
Conflicting achievement

criteria rules

|Some define achievements using exercise totals; others using workout or
routine completion. |Users may unlock achievements prematurely or never
unlock them, reducing app trust.

|*Milestone* |Milestone vs Achievement confusion |Teams may treat
milestones as achievements or vice versa. |Gamification loop becomes
unclear = users experience progression inconsistencies.

|*Balance* |Different definitions of “balance” a|
Some teams

interpret balance as equal muscle group training; others as fatigue/rest
management.

|Overtraining warnings become unreliable or contradict fitness
recommendations.

|*Notification* |Misaligned event triggers |Some events trigger
notifications in domain logic; others trigger from UI logic. |Duplicate
notifications, missing alerts, or inconsistent user experience.

a|
*Workout*

*Completion Event*

|Different interpretations of completion |One team considers partial
completion “done”; another requires 100% completion. |Achievements, XP,
or rewards may become corrupted, affecting gamified progression.

|*Personal Best Event* |Conflicting PB calculation rules a|
Some use last session

comparison; others use lifetime highest value.

|PB based badges or streaks become inaccurate, discouraging users.

|*Overtraining Warning Event* |Multiple metrics for overtraining |One
uses frequency; another uses muscle fatigue scoring. |Users may receive
contradictory warnings.
