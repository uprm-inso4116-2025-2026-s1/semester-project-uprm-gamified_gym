== 1. Core Domain

The Core Domain refers to the distinct value-adding dimensions that set
“GamifiedGym” apart from its competitors. It is this “special aspect” as
articulated in the lecture that resolves the fundamental issue that
currently pervades the market as being “saturated with products that
solely focus on data logging” (Milestone2, 1.2.1).

The Core Domain is Gamified Fitness Journey & Balanced Progression
System. It is not one feature, but a blend of mechanics that aim to
“encourage consistency, effort, and varied workouts” (1.2.2).

== 2. Supporting Subdomains

These are required subdomains that the Domain Core leans on as a
requirement for functionality. They are not themselves value-added
offerings, though required and sometimes heavy on up-front development
investment.

is what competitors also can/might be doing).
