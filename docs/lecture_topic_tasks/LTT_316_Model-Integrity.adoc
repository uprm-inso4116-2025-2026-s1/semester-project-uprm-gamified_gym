== Lecture Topic Task 2  
Using Model Integrity Principles to Structure Milestone 3 Documentation

=== 1. Objective
The objective of this task is to apply concepts from the *Maintaining Model Integrity* lecture to design a
structured, consistent, and rubric-aligned documentation format for Milestone 3.  
Key ideas used include bounded contexts, explicit terminology, and integrity-preserving modeling practices.

The goal is to ensure that the Milestone 3 `.adoc` documentation remains coherent, internally consistent, and
fully compliant with project expectations, while avoiding fragmentation or contradictory descriptions.

=== 2. Task Description
This task applies principles from the *Maintaining Model Integrity* lecture—particularly bounded contexts,
avoiding model splinters, preventing duplicate definitions, and maintaining stable terminology across
documentation.

Milestone 3 requires a documentation format that:

* Integrates changes clearly  
* Demonstrates progress across the project  
* Aligns with the rubric for structured presentation  
* Shows traceable updates  
* Covers domain, requirements, architecture, design, and testing  

Using the lecture’s guidelines, a structured `.adoc` format was developed that:

* Separates concerns cleanly  
* Uses consistent vocabulary  
* Avoids duplicate or conflicting explanations  
* Maintains visible connections to Milestones 1–2  
* Frames updates inside clearly identifiable contexts  

The result is a documentation structure grounded in model integrity principles that supports clarity,
consistency, and collaborative editing.

=== 3. Explanation of Lecture Concept
The *Maintaining Model Integrity* lecture emphasizes preserving the internal consistency and conceptual clarity
of a system’s model as it evolves.

Key ideas include:

* **Bounded Contexts** — large systems must be divided into conceptual regions where terminology,
responsibilities, and rules remain internally consistent.
* **Avoiding Model Splinters** — the same concept must not be defined differently in multiple places.
* **Preventing False Cognates** — similar-sounding terms must not refer to contradictory ideas.
* **Context Maps** — clarify relationships between parts of the model and prevent conceptual mixing.
* **Continuous Integration of the Model** — updates must remain synchronized and not diverge into
incompatible versions.

These principles ensure documentation evolves consistently and remains understandable to all contributors.

=== 4. Example (Outside the Project)
Consider a company producing three manuals for the same product—engineering, marketing, and support.
Each manual uses different terminology and conflicting descriptions. This failure in model integrity leads to:

* customer confusion  
* internal miscommunication  
* contradictory documentation  
* difficulty onboarding new staff  

Applying bounded contexts and unified terminology removes these contradictions and maintains clarity.

=== 5. Application to the Gamified Gym Project
Milestone 3 requires a well-structured `.adoc` submission that:

* clearly shows integrated changes from prior milestones  
* avoids contradictions and duplicated explanations  
* covers domain, requirements, architecture, design, and testing  
* satisfies rubric expectations for narrative clarity and visible improvements  

Across Milestones 1–2, documentation suffered from inconsistent terminology, overlapping sections, and
re-defined concepts. Requirements blended with design, and contradictory descriptions appeared — matching
exactly the issues described in the lecture.

Using *Maintaining Model Integrity*, a structured AsciiDoc format for Milestone 3 was designed with
bounded contexts:

* **Domain Context** — domain model, concept definitions  
* **Requirements Context** — user stories, system responsibilities  
* **Architecture Context** — subsystems, interfaces, boundaries  
* **Design Context** — design techniques, diagrams, refinements  
* **Testing Context** — test plan, test cases, coverage  
* **Change Log Context** — visible improvements over Milestones 1–2  

The format also applies:

* unified terminology  
* single definitions per concept  
* no duplicated domain or requirement descriptions  
* a context map linking all documentation elements  

This prevents model splinters and preserves integrity as the document grows.

=== 6. Reflection
This task showed that model integrity concepts have a strong effect on documentation quality. Applying
bounded contexts, stable terminology, and awareness of splinters produced a clearer, rubric-aligned
structure for Milestone 3.

I now understand documentation not just as writing, but as actively preserving the integrity of the model as
the project evolves. The structured format created through this task will support the entire team by making
Milestone 3 easier to maintain, extend, and align with project guidelines.
