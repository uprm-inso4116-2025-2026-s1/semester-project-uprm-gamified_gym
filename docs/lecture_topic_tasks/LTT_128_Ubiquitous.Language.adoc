== *Project Glossary: Gamified Gym*

Goal: To develop a Ubiquitous Language for the team on the project, to
enable a proper and consistent communication among developers and
amongst designers.

A core principle of the Ubiquitous Language is that it must extend
directly into the codebase. The terms defined in this glossary should be
used precisely for naming our classes, variables, and methods.
