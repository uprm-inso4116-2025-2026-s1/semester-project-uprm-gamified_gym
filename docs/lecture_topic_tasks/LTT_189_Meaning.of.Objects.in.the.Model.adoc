*Lecture Topic Task – Meaning of Objects in the Model*
____

*Gamified Gym Objective:*

To define the meaning and responsibilities of the core objects in the
_Gamified Gym_’s game design model. Each object should clearly represent
its purpose in motivating users, follow the principles from the slides
of _“Meaning of Objects in the Model”_, and establish whether it is an
*Entity* or a *Value Object*. This definition provides a shared
understanding for the team and ensures consistency when integrating with
the Fitness Tracker and Foundations teams.

*Task Description:*

Each object in the game design model must have a defined purpose and
scope. Following the lecture’s principle that _“each object has a clear
meaning and responsibility within the domain”_, we ensure that the model
captures the essence of motivation, progress, and visual feedback.

The following section defines the main game-related objects and explains
their meaning, type, and relationships.

*Identified Objects and Their Meanings:*

== Achievement (Entity) 

* *Meaning:* Represents a specific accomplishment reached by a user, for
example completing 20 workouts or training 5 consecutive days.
* *Reason for Entity:* Each achievement must have a unique identity
since it tracks user progress over time.
* *Relationships:* Earned by a _User Progress_ instance, which is linked
to one or more _Badges_ that visually represent it.

== Badge (Value Object) 

* *Meaning:* A visual icon that symbolizes the completion of an
achievement or set of milestones.
* *Reason for Value Object:* It is purely visual representation; two
identical badges have no distinct identity.
* *Relationships:* Associated with _achievements_ and _milestones_ to
provide visual motivation.

== Milestone (Entity) 

* *Meaning:* A predefined goal or threshold within a user’s fitness
journey. An example would be: “Burn 10,000 calories”.
* *Reason for Entity:* Each Milestone tracks its completion status and
relates to the user’s ongoing progress.
* *Relationships:* When reached, it triggers the creation or unlocking
of an _achievement_.

== User Progress (Entity) 

* *Meaning:* Tracks the user’s accumulated activity metrics, such as
total workouts logged.
* *Reason for Entity:* Must persist and evolve over time for each user.
* *Relationships:* Generates _achievements_ when certain _milestones_
are met.

== Reward Criteria (Value Object) 

* *Meaning:* Defines the logic or thresholds required for a user to earn
a specific achievement (e.g., “5 workouts in one week”).
* *Reason for Value Object:* Represents a rule or condition, not a
specific identifiable concept.
* *Relationships:* Used by _achievements_ and _milestones_ to evaluate
completion.

== Badge Design (Value Object) 

* *Meaning:* Contains visual elements such as icon style, color palette,
and animation.
* *Reason for Value Object:* It is purely visual representation, not a
persistent entity.
* *Relationships:* Associated with _badge_ objects to enhance visual
engagement.
