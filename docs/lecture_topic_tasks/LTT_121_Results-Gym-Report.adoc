== Lecture Topic: Isolating the Domain – Report Summary

This lecture topic explored whether our fitness and gamification application should adopt a 
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture or remain a Smart UI–oriented system.

A Google Form was distributed to evaluate the team's understanding of domain isolation, 
the separation of core domain logic from UI concerns, and the perceived architectural 
complexity of our current project. Although only a few responses were collected, the feedback 
indicated that domain logic appears partially mixed across components, with some behaviors 
residing inside UI classes instead of the domain.

At this stage, no architectural changes will be enforced. Fully isolating the domain layer 
would require broader team consensus, technical validation, and a more mature understanding 
of the domain model.

=== Conclusion

The lecture topic concludes with the following general observation:

*"Our project’s domain awareness is growing, but it is still early to formally separate the domain layer."*

This summary closes the lecture topic task for **Isolating the Domain**.
