*Lecture Topic Task: Modeling the Life Cycle of a Workout in a Fitness
Tracker*

== Introduction 

One of the ideas we’ve talked about in class is how domain objects don’t
just sit still — they move through different stages, and our designs
should reflect that. This is what the _life cycle of a domain object_ is
all about. For my task, I decided to connect that concept to fitness
tracking, since that’s the project I’m working on. A workout session in
an app isn’t just static data; it starts, changes, and eventually gets
stored as history. Modeling its life cycle helps us see how theory from
class applies to something practical.

== From Class to Fitness Tracking 

The lecture explained how objects go through states, have rules
(invariants) that never change, and need good design patterns like
factories and repositories to handle creation and storage. That clicked
for me when I thought about how workouts work in a fitness app. When you
open a new workout, it doesn’t just “exist” right away as finished data
— it’s created, edited while you log your sets, and then marked as
complete when you’re done. Later on, the app might archive it so you
can’t edit it anymore but can still look back at it.

== The Workout Life Cycle 

The main object here is a *Workout*. Its life cycle looks like this:

[arabic]
. *Draft* – you start a new workout but haven’t logged anything yet.
. *Active* – you’re in the middle of the workout, adding exercises,
sets, and reps.
. *Completed* – you finish the workout and save it.
. *Archived* – the workout is old, no longer editable, but still part of
your history.

That flow feels natural because it mirrors what we do in real life: plan
a workout, do it, and then record it for later.

== Rules That Always Hold (Invariants) 

Even while a workout changes states, some things must always be true:

* You can’t mark a workout “completed” if it doesn’t have at least one
exercise.
* You shouldn’t have duplicate exercises inside the same workout.
* Dates and times have to make sense (no workouts in the year 1900 by
mistake).
* Once a workout is archived, it stays locked — you can view it, but you
can’t edit it.

== Factories and Repositories 

Factories are useful here because they can handle the creation of
workouts in a clean, controlled way. For example, a WorkoutFactory could
make sure every new workout starts as a draft with the right info (user
ID, date, empty list of exercises). Repositories make sense for storage
— a WorkoutRepository could let you grab all of your past workouts,
whether they’re in a database, on Firebase, or somewhere else. That way,
the domain logic doesn’t depend on the storage method.

== Example Flow 

If I drew a diagram, it would show Draft → Active → Completed → Archived
as the main path. You can’t skip steps, like going from Draft straight
to Archived, and there are rules (like needing exercises) that act as
“guards” before a state change is allowed.

== Testing the Idea 

A few tests make sure the design works:

* Trying to complete a workout with zero exercises should throw an
error.
* Archived workouts should load normally but be read-only.
* Any workout made through the factory should have basic info filled out
automatically.

== Why It Matters 

This kind of modeling isn’t just theory — it’s how real fitness apps
work. Apps like Strava or Fitbod keep strict workout histories and don’t
let you change them once they’re finished. By thinking about a workout
as a domain object with a life cycle, we build a more realistic and
reliable system.

== Conclusion 

Modeling the life cycle of a workout shows how the class concepts about
domain objects directly apply to the fitness tracker project. A workout
moves through clear stages, keeps its rules intact, and needs proper
support through factories and repositories. It’s a simple example, but
it shows why domain-driven design matters — it helps us design software
that matches real-world behavior and avoids problems down the road.
