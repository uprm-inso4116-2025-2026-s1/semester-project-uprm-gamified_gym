*Creating Associations for the*

*Gamified Gym App*

== Introduction

Associations in object-oriented design represent how entities relate,
interact, and depend on each other. A well-modeled association reflects
real-world relationships and ensures that the software accurately
expresses domain logic.

In the *Gamified Gym App*, core entities such as User, Workout,
Exercise, Achievement, Challenge, Reward, and Level must be connected
through meaningful associations that mirror gamification behavior.

This lecture topic explores *association types, navigability, and
improvement strategies* to ensure a precise and maintainable domain
model.

== Types of Associations

=== One-to-One

A one-to-one association links exactly one instance of Entity A to one
instance of Entity B. *Example:* Each UserProfile is associated with
exactly one User account.

*Implementation Notes:* - Represented with a single reference (attribute
or pointer) in the owning class. - Common when both objects share life
cycle dependency (composition).

=== One-to-Many

A one-to-many association links one instance of Entity A with multiple
instances of Entity B. *Example:* - One User can log multiple Workout
sessions. - One Workout can contain many Exercise objects.

*Implementation Notes:* - Represented with a collection (e.g., list,
array, or set) in the owning class. Traversal typically occurs from the
“one” side to the “many.”

=== Many-to-Many

A many-to-many association occurs when multiple instances of one entity
are linked to multiple instances of another. *Example:* - Users can
participate in multiple Challenges, and each Challenge can have multiple
Users.

*Implementation Notes:* - Represented using an intermediate linking
entity (e.g., UserChallenge). These associations often emerge early in
modeling and can later be simplified through refactoring.

== Improving Associations

To improve clarity and reduce complexity: - *Define traversal
direction:* Determine whether associations are uni- or bi-directional. -
*Add qualifiers:* Restrict association scope using keys (e.g.,
“activeChallenge” vs. “pastChallenge”). - *Eliminate non-essential
links:* Remove redundant or unused relationships to simplify navigation.

== Example from Lecture: President of a Country

In the lecture example: - Initially, Country ↔ Person was modeled as a
*many-to-many* association. Refining it with a *qualifier* (only one
president per country at a time) transformed it into a *one-toone*
relationship. - This illustrates how qualification reveals the true
domain meaning and simplifies design.

== Applying to Gamified Gym

Below are associations relevant to the Gamified Gym domain model:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|*Source Entity* |*Target Entity* |*Association Type*
|User |Workout |One-to-Many
|Workout |Exercise |One-to-Many
|User |Achievement |One-to-Many
|User |Challenge |Many-to-Many
|Challenge |Reward |One-to-One
|User |Level |One-to-One
|===

*Ownership Rules:* - User owns Workout and Achievement entities. -
Challenge maintains a separate lifecycle and links to users via a
bridging entity. - Reward depends on Challenge completion (composition).
- Aggregates are formed where a parent entity controls the lifecycle of
its dependents.

== Navigability

Each association must define which entities can access or reference
others: - User → Workout

(navigable) - Workout → Exercise (navigable) - Challenge ↔ User
(bi-directional through link class) User → Achievement (navigable,
unidirectional) - Challenge → Reward (navigable) This ensures clean
relationships and aligns with DDD design principles.

== Alignment with Domain-Driven Design

The associations are consistent with the *Ubiquitous Language* of
Gamified Gym: - *User:* The central actor. - *Workout:* Aggregates
Exercises. - *Challenge:* Connects multiple users competitively. -
*Reward:* Granted upon Challenge completion. - *Level:* Represents user
progression.

Each association reflects behavior observable in real gym and fitness
systems.

== Conclusion

By applying association design techniques from “A Model Expressed in
Software,” the Gamified Gym domain model now includes well-defined,
navigable, and meaningful relationships. The associations follow
domain-driven principles, clarify ownership, and improve model
expressiveness while maintaining implementation simplicity.

== Acceptance Criteria (Met)

* All major entities have associations clearly defined and documented.
* Relationships are accurate, consistent, and domain-aligned.
* Proper notation for association types and cardinality is used.
* Ownership and aggregation rules are explicitly stated.
* Examples of traversal, qualifiers, and simplifications are included.
