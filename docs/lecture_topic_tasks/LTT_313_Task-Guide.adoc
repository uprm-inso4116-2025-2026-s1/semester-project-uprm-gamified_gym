== Lecture Topic Task
=== Exposing Hidden Concepts and Rules to Strengthen Project Documentation

==== 1. Explanation of the Lecture Concept
(Slides 2–6 and 16–23 from *Making Implicit Concepts Explicit*)

This lecture explains that many teams unintentionally hide essential domain knowledge inside their code,
conversations, or private assumptions. These implicit concepts—critical ideas the team depends on but never
writes down—lead to confusion, inconsistent terminology, and a situation where only a few members actually
understand how the system works.

The slides emphasize that teams must deliberately *make these concepts explicit* by naming them, defining them,
and connecting them to the model so that everyone shares the same understanding.

The lecture also explains that systems frequently contain implicit rules—constraints or behaviors that exist
but are not clearly expressed. When these rules remain buried inside implementation details:

* the team cannot reason about them,
* they cannot be tested,
* they cannot be documented,
* and only the person who originally wrote the code knows they exist.

Making implicit rules explicit keeps the model consistent, testable, and learnable for all members.

==== 2. Example (Outside the Project)

Imagine a restaurant kitchen where only one chef knows the recipe for the most popular dish.
Others may help cook, but they guess ingredient amounts, timing, and plating. Since the recipe exists only
in one person’s memory, results differ every time.

Because the recipe is implicit:

* the kitchen cannot create documentation,
* new cooks cannot be trained,
* mistakes cannot be corrected,
* and the entire workflow collapses if the head chef is unavailable.

In this example:

*the recipe is an implicit concept*  
*the cooking steps are implicit constraints*

Making the recipe explicit—listing ingredients, quantities, timings, and rules—would allow the whole kitchen
to work consistently and collaboratively.

==== 3. Application to the Gamified Gym Project

The Gamified Gym team currently faces a significant knowledge bottleneck:
**only one person out of 25 understands how the backend works.**

This makes backend behavior an implicit concept—hidden, undocumented, and inaccessible to most team members.
As a result:

* Developers cannot reason about backend behavior  
* Frontend members cannot verify their features  
* Testers cannot validate outcomes  
* Documentation remains incomplete  
* The team depends entirely on one backend contributor  
* Progress stops any time that person is unavailable  

Using the lecture’s principle of *making implicit concepts explicit*, we can clarify backend behavior
without touching the backend code at all.

By mapping what the backend must do at each step of the user journey, we expose the backend’s domain
responsibilities. This eliminates the dependency on a single contributor and allows documentation,
testing, and coordinated development to continue.

==== 4. Backend Behavior Along the User Journey (Explicit Modeling Guide)

Below is a narrated walkthrough of the app from login to completing a workout.  
At every step, backend responsibilities are made explicit using domain concepts.

===== 1. User Opens the App & Logs In
*Frontend Behavior:* User enters credentials and loads their dashboard.

*Backend Responsibilities:*
* Authenticate user  
* Load athlete profile  
* Fetch recent sessions and progress metrics  
* Deliver pending notifications  

===== 2. Home / Dashboard Screen
*Frontend Behavior:* Displays progress summary, achievements, and warnings.

*Backend Responsibilities:*
* Query sessions  
* Compute totals, trends, and warnings  
* Return dashboard data  

===== 3. Starting a Workout or Routine
*Frontend Behavior:* User starts a workout or selects a routine.

*Backend Responsibilities:*
* Fetch routine or starting template  
* Create new WorkoutSession aggregate  
* Return structured exercise list  

===== 4. Logging Exercises During the Workout
*Frontend Behavior:* User logs sets, reps, and loads.

*Backend Responsibilities:*
* Store set entries  
* Tag muscle groups  
* Update per-exercise and per-session metrics  

===== 5. Completing the Workout
*Frontend Behavior:* User saves the session.

*Backend Responsibilities:*
* Finalize session  
* Compute volume, load, training distribution  
* Evaluate achievements and milestones  
* Trigger notifications  

===== 6. Viewing History / Stats
*Backend Responsibilities:*
* Aggregate past sessions  
* Detect trends and plateaus  
* Return data for visualizations  

===== 7. Editing Profile
*Backend Responsibilities:*
* Update athlete profile  
* Adjust future calculations and personalized behaviors

==== 5. Reflection

This task demonstrated how powerful explicit concept modeling is in a team with uneven expertise.
Our project had a severe dependency on a single backend contributor, which prevented the rest of the team from
understanding or documenting backend behavior.

By mapping backend responsibilities along the user journey, I now have a clear shared reference that
reduces this dependency and enables others to contribute meaningfully to:

* documentation  
* feature design  
* testing  
* overall architecture understanding  

This method will continue to help whenever the team encounters hidden assumptions or unclear domain behavior.

==== 6. Optional Implementation Notes

If adopted, this explicit mapping would:

* Help frontend developers verify backend connections  
* Enable documentation writers to describe system behavior accurately  
* Let testers generate meaningful test cases  
* Reduce load on the single backend developer  
* Create team-wide shared understanding of the system
