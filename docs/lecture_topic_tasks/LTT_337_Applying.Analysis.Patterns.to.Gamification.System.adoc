Lecture Topic Task - Applying Analysis Patterns to Gamification System

[arabic]
. Introduction

The Applying Analysis Patterns lecture introduces a set of recurring
conceptual patterns used to deepen domain modeling — especially in
systems that rely on historical data, event recording, and rule-driven
transformations. These patterns are ideal for the Gamified Gym project
because the game accumulated workout data, and rules that determine when
a user earns a reward.

The goal is to propose a structured and extensible war to evaluate
achievements, compute progress, and record the history of rewards earned
using the lecture’s ideas such as Entries, Transactions, Derived
Records, and Posting Rules.

. Applying the Patterns to the Game Design Team

== Workout Logs as “Entries” 

____
- Each workout the user logs becomes an immutable Entry object with
timestamp, exercise list, total volume and muscle groups.
____

== Achievements as “Derived Records” 

____
- Instead of storing Booleans like ‘achievementEarned = true’, we treat
the earning of an achievement as generating a derived entry
(EarnedAchievement)
____

== AchievementEarned as “Posting Rules” 

____
- Each achievement has a corresponding posting rule that defines input
account (WorkoutHistory), triggering event (new WorkoutEntry), and
output (EarnedAchievement).
____

== Firing Modes as “Achievements” 

____
- Examples include eager firing for streak achievements, deferred firing
for periodic evaluations, and rule-based challenges
