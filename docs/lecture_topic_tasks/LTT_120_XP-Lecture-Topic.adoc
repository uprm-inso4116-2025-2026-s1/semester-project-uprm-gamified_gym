== Lecture Topic: Extreme Programming – Concluded

=== Proposal Summary

This lecture topic applied key principles of Extreme Programming (XP) to improve the team’s current workflow.  
The resulting proposal defines **three practical, actionable policies** that strengthen verification, documentation, and domain alignment across sub-teams.

=== Policy 1: Video Validation Requirement

Every coding-related task must include a short video test run demonstrating the implemented behavior.  
This policy reinforces XP’s principle that *“running code does not lie.”*

*Purpose:*
- Validate correctness with minimal ambiguity.
- Strengthen shared understanding across the team.
- Provide lightweight evidence during reviews.

*Rules:*
- Each video must be 10–45 seconds.
- It must show the implemented feature in use.
- Missing videos temporarily reduce the associated task’s urgency score.

=== Policy 2: AsciiDoc Documentation Workflow

Each sub-team maintains a single evolving AsciiDoc file that summarizes:
- Current drafts  
- Technical decisions  
- Implemented behavior  
- Pending updates  

*Purpose:*
- Produce a living, continuously updated document.
- Reduce fragmentation in team communication.
- Align documentation practices with XP’s incremental delivery mindset.

*Rules:*
- Each update must be appended, not replaced.
- Documentation quality contributes to the task scoring.
- Missing updates reduce the task’s urgency value until resolved.

=== Policy 3: Domain Justification Requirement

All sub-teams must include a section explaining how their work supports the project’s **overall domain model**.

*Purpose:*
- Maintain conceptual integrity across all components.
- Encourage domain-driven reasoning rather than purely technical work.
- Ensure each feature contributes meaningfully to GamifiedGym’s core concepts.

*Rules:*
- Every major feature must include a Domain Justification paragraph.
- Missing justification reduces the task’s urgency score.

=== Scoring System: Urgency × Difficulty

Each policy uses a shared scoring structure:

*Urgency × Difficulty Score*

- Urgency measures relevance to milestone deliverables.
- Difficulty measures technical or conceptual complexity.
- Missing required artifacts (video, documentation, or justification) reduce urgency temporarily.
- The combined score helps prioritize tasks for upcoming sprints.

=== Completion Statement

This proposal has been fully drafted, formatted, and documented for internal review.  
It is now pending team discussion and approval for integration into future sprints.

This submission completes the lecture topic requirement for **Extreme Programming**, translating XP principles into structured, enforceable team procedures for ongoing development.
