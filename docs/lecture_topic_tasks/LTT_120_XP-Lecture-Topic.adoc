Lecture Topic: Extreme Programming – Concluded
 Proposal Summary
 This lecture topic focused on applying principles of Extreme Programming (XP) to our current team
 workflow. The resulting proposal introduces three practical policies:
 1. Video Validation Requirement: Every coding task includes a short video test run to verify function
 and reinforce XP’s “running code does not lie.”
 2. AsciiDoc Documentation Workflow: Each sub-team maintains one evolving AsciiDoc file
 summarizing current drafts, decisions, and implementation progress.
 3. Domain Justification Section: Each sub-team explains how their component supports the project’s
 overall domain.
 Each of these policies includes a scoring system based on Urgency × Difficulty, where missing
 deliverables (videos or documentation) temporarily reduce urgency.
 The proposal has been fully documented and formatted for internal review; it’s now pending team
 discussion and approval for future sprints.
 This submission completes the lecture topic task for Extreme Programming, as it translates key XP
 principles into actionable team procedures
