Title: Practical Workshop: Reducing Ignorance in the Fitness

* Objective

To enable students to identify, analyze and address gaps in knowledge
during the development of a gamified fitness tracking app using the Five
Levels of Ignorance framework.

* Description

This lecture focuses on the Five Levels of Ignorance (0OI to 4OI) as a
tool for improving domain modeling and reducing ignorance in software
projects. Using the example of a gamified fitness app, where users track
gym progress and earn badges, students will learn how to recognize
unknown unknowns, structure learning processes and set domain knowledge
into the design.

* Tasks
. Read and summarize the Five Levels of Ignorance as presented in the
slides.

____
○ Identify at least three examples of 2OI in the context of the gamified
fitness app.

○ Propose a 3OI reduction process for one of the identified 2OI
examples.

○ Refactor a sample code snippet to make a hidden business rule, such as
badge eligibility, to be explicit in the model.

○ Write a short reflection on how continuous ignorance reduction can
improve the app’s design and user experience.
____

* Completion Criteria
. A written summary of the Five Levels of Ignorance

____

I. Summary of the Five Levels of Ignorance

These are Five Levels of Ignorance (5OI) framework that does not
conceptualize software development as a production activity, it
conceptualizes software development as a continuous process of knowledge
acquisition and ignorance reduction.

* 0th Order Ignorance (0OI): Represents a state of proven knowledge. A
requirement or feature is understood and has been successfully
implemented and validated. For instance, the team has 0OI on the process
for a user to log a completed workout.
* 1st Order Ignorance (1OI): This is a "known unknown." The team is
aware of a

____
specific gap in their knowledge. An example would be knowing that the
algorithm for calculating a user's "Overall Fitness Level" has not been
defined and this is a recognized item on the project backlog.
____

* 2nd Order Ignorance (2OI): This represents the most critical area of
risk: the "unknown unknowns." The team is unaware of a gap in their
knowledge. These are assumptions, hidden user behaviors, or edge cases
that have not been considered but will significantly impact the system's
success.
* 3rd Order Ignorance (3OI): This is the lack of a suitable and
efficient process for uncovering 2OI. Relying only on user feedback
after a public release is an example of a default and inefficient 3OI
process. Effective methodologies are structured 3OI reduction processes.
* 4th Order Ignorance (4OI): This is ignorance of the 5OI framework
itself. By studying and applying this model, the project team has
already reduced its 4OI and enabled a more strategic approach to
knowledge acquisition.

The core objective in domain driven design is to actively reduce 2OI by
implementing effective 3OI processes, which converts unknown unknowns
into manageable known unknowns and ultimately into proven knowledge.

{empty}II. Identified examples of 2OI in the Gamified app

In the context of the Gamified app, the following are three potential
areas of 2nd Order Ignorance:

* The "Social Driver" Assumption: The development team, primarily
focused on personal tracking, may be completely unaware that a key
factor for long term user engagement is social competition and
accountability. Not having features like shared challenges or a friend’s
leaderboard might be a critical oversight, unknown to the team until
user retention metrics reveal the problem after the launch.
* Exploitation of Achievement Systems: The team may not realize that
their defined rules for badges contain loopholes. For example, they
might be unaware that a user can earn the "Weekly Dedication" badge by
logging multiple, insignificant one-minute workouts, thereby fulfilling
the letter of the rule ("7 workouts a week") while violating its intent,
which degrades the badge's value.
* Ignorance of Overtraining as a Retention Killer: The team's model may
reward constant activity, unaware that a significant segment of their
target audience will experience burnout and lose motivation due to not
having rewards for recovery and rest. The concept of modeling "recovery
days" as a positive action may be an entirely missing part of the domain
model.

Proposed 3OI Reduction Process for a Selected 2OI
____

Selected 2OI Example: #2 - Exploitation of Achievement Systems.

Proposed 3OI Process: "Before the launch the launch badge integrity
assessment"

To efficiently find these hidden vulnerabilities in our gamification
model, we propose the following structured process:

* Formalized "Badge-Gaming" Workshop: Prior to development, have a
dedicated session involving developers, product managers and fitness
domain experts. The explicit goal is to brainstorm ways a user could
"game" or earn a proposed badge without genuine effort. This shifts the
perspective from implementation to exploitation, revealing flawed
business logic early.
* Implementation of a "Rules Sandbox" for Beta Testers: In the closed
beta phase, provide a transparent view of the badge eligibility rules to
a select user group. Instead of a black box, users see the logic such as
"This badge requires 5 workouts of at least 45 minutes this week".
Actively solicit feedback on whether these rules seem fair, achievable,
and resistant to "cheap" completion. This turns beta testers into active
collaborators in perfecting the system.
* Analytics Driven Unusual Detection: Instrument the beta app to flag
unusual badge earning behavior. For instance, if the "Strength Master"
badge is earned by a user whose logged weights are unbelievably low, the
system would flag this event for review by the product team, revealing
an unknown loophole.

This multi-stage process is a far more efficient and suitable method for
uncovering 2OI than the passive approach of waiting for user complaints
after the launch.

____
Refactoring for an Explicit Domain Model
____

Scenario: The business rule for awarding the "Marathon Month" badge is
currently buried within the application's service layer logic, stated
simply as "if monthly workout count is greater than or equal to 20."
This is a hidden concept, inaccessible to domain experts and prone to
being implemented inconsistently.

A method for refactoring:

Instead of leaving this rule as a conditional statement in a procedure,
we would refactor the domain model to make the concept of an eligibility
rule a first class citizen. The "Marathon Month" badge would be
associated with a specific workout count eligibility rule object. This
object would contain the explicit business logic and the threshold value
such as required workouts is 20.

Explanation:

This refactoring elevates the hidden business rule into an explicit part
of the domain model. The concept of a rule that governs badge
eligibility becomes a tangible, discussable entity. A domain expert can
now look at the model and immediately understand what the "Marathon
Month" badge represents and without needing to decipher code. This
creates a knowledge rich design where the core concepts of the fitness
gamification domain such as badges, achievements and the rules that
govern them are clearly reflected and accessible to the entire
functional team.

V. Reflection on Continuous Ignorance Reduction

Embracing continuous ignorance reduction is fundamental to evolving the
gamified app from a simple tracking tool into a deeply engaging and
sustainable platform. The 5OI framework provides a shared vocabulary and
a strategic imperative to proactively seek out what we do not know. By
uncovering our "unknown unknowns" such as hidden user motivations,
unintended gamification loopholes or the critical importance of recovery
so we can continually refine our domain model. This process ensures that
the app's design and features are not based on initial assumptions but
are instead informed by discovered knowledge. The result is a product
that more accurately reflects the complex, real world domain of fitness
and motivation, leading to a better user satisfaction, long-term
retention and a competitive design.
